# Edict Of Autonomy

---

This document, the "Edict of Autonomy," serves as the high-level structural blueprint for our new digital ecosystemâ€”the foundational "What" we are building. Where the Manifesto answers "Why," this Edict defines the vision, principles, and core components of a system designed from the ground up to be decentralized, honoring the sovereign autonomy of the individual and the community.

> - _Why?_ [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/)
> - **What?** **Edict of Autonomy**
> - _How?_ [Acts of Emergence](../acts/)

The Edict lays out this architecture in a structured format. "The Vision" establishes the high-level goals. "The Protocol" defines the core architectural concepts. "The Impact" explores the societal and individual consequences of adopting this model. It provides a comprehensive overview of the system's design without delving into the granular implementation details of each component.

This document is the bridge between philosophy and implementation. It is complemented by [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (The Why) and the detailed technical specifications in our [Acts of Emergence](../acts/) (The How). Reading this document will provide a complete understanding of the system's architecture and its intended purpose.
