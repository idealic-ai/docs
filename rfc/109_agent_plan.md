This document describes the **Plan Protocol**, a system for creating and executing complex, multi-step workflows as a graph of `Tool Calls`.

A `Plan` is an executable graph of actions that is designed to be run within an **[Agent: Loop](./104_agent_loop.md)**. While a single iteration of the loop can execute a set of parallel `Call`s, a `Plan` allows the agent to define and follow a multi-step sequence with dependencies, effectively orchestrating a series of loops to achieve a larger goal.
