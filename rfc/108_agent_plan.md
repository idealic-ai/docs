> **Plan:** A directed acyclic graph (DAG) of `Tool Calls`. It defines a sequence of actions, with dependencies determined by tools reading from and writing to the `State Object`.
>
> **Plot:** A branching scenario within a `Plan` designed to handle unexpected or non-deterministic outcomes, allowing for paths like `A -> B -> C` or `A -> B -> D`.

This document describes the **Plan Protocol**, a system for creating and executing complex, multi-step workflows as a graph of `Tool Calls`.
