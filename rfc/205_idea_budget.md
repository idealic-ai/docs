A **Budget Idea** is a living economic engine, not just a number. It's an Idea that combines **authority** (permission to act, defined in its `schema`) and **resources** (spendable assets, tracked in its `solution`). It governs all significant changes in the system through the `refine` primitive. It seems to be a specialization of a **Capability Idea**.
