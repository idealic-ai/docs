# RFC index

The RFC (Request for Comments) documents define the technical protocols of the system. They cover the core data structure ("The Idea Protocol"), how ideas are executed ("The Call Protocol"), and how context is managed ("Imports," "Input," and "Instancing" protocols). A key vision document outlines "The Reactor," a universal runtime for stateful agents.
