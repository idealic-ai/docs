# Glossary of Terms

This document provides definitions for the key concepts used in the Idea Protocol and its related systems.

- **Idea**: A self-contained, stateful data triplet (`schema`, `solution`, `context`) representing a unit of knowledge. It's a persistent, computational primitive, not an ephemeral prompt.

- **Ideator**: An `Idea` that accepts input, signified by a context message of `type: "input"`. It acts as a function, transforming input to output.

- **Idea Transformer**: A specialized `Ideator` that takes another `Idea` as its input.

- **Input Message**: A context message containing a `schema` and `input` data. Its presence transforms an `Idea` into an `Ideator` by defining its expected inputs.

- **Tool**: An `Idea` inverted to be interface-focused. It's a function signature registered in an agent's system, ready to be called. Its schema defines parameters (inputs) and `_output` (expected result).

- **Call**: A concrete, executable instance of a `Tool`, with specific values for its `params`. It's an invocation-focused request for what _should be done_.

- **Scope**: The locus of execution for a `Call`.
  - **Inline Scope**: The `Call` is processed in the current agent's context.
  - **Module Scope**: The `Call` is delegated to an external, isolated module.

- **Method**: The mechanism of execution for a `Call`.
  - **Explicit Execution**: The `Call`'s output is generated by deterministic code (an `Activity`).
  - **Latent Execution**: The `Call`'s output is generated by an LLM.

- **Module**: An external, reusable unit of logic (an `Activity` or an `Idea`) that can be invoked via a `Call` with a `Module Scope`. Signaled by the `_module` property.

- **Import**: A key that identifies a piece of context from the parent environment to be made available (`imported`) to an execution. It can be used to focus an LLM's attention in a **Latent Inline** execution or to construct the entire context for a **Module Scope** execution. Controlled by the `_imports` property.

- **State Object**: A mutable, JSON-like object that bridges the planning and execution phases. It acts as the target for tool outputs and the source for dependency analysis when building a `Planning Graph`.

- **Planning Graph**: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) of `Tool Calls` generated by the LLM. The graph's dependencies are derived from tools reading from and writing to the `State Object`.

- **Instancing**: The process of handling multiple, independent `Instances` (each with its own `State Object` and unique identifier) within a single agent request.

- **Instance**: A single, uniquely identified state object and its associated context, processed as one of many within an `Instancing` operation.

- **Reactor**: A specific `Idea Transformer` designed as a universal runtime for stateful, turn-based agent interactions. It takes a game/process state (`Idea`) and produces the next state (`Idea`).
