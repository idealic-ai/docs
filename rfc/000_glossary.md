# 000: Glossary of Terms

This document provides definitions for the key concepts used in the Idea Protocol and its related systems.

- **Idea**: A self-contained, stateful data triplet (`schema`, `solution`, `context`) representing a unit of knowledge. It's a persistent, computational primitive, not an ephemeral prompt.

- **Ideator**: An `Idea` that accepts input, signified by a context message of `type: "input"`. It acts as a function, transforming input to output.

- **Idea Transformer**: A specialized `Ideator` that takes another `Idea` as its input.

- **Input Message**: A context message containing a `schema` and `input` data. Its presence transforms an `Idea` into an `Ideator` by defining its expected inputs.

- **Tool**: A schema that defines a capability an agent can use. It is presented to an LLM as part of a request, acting as a structured interface for a potential action. The LLM activates the tool by generating a `Call` with specific parameters, which is then executed either latently by the LLM or explicitly by a registered code function (`Activity`).

- **Call**: A concrete, executable instance of a `Tool`, with specific values for its `params`. It's an invocation-focused request for what _should be done_.

- **Scope**: The locus of execution for a `Call`.
  - **Inline Scope**: The `Call` is processed in the current agent's context.
  - **Module Scope**: The `Call` is delegated to an external, isolated module.

- **Method**: The mechanism of execution for a `Call`.
  - **Explicit Execution**: The `Call`'s output is generated by deterministic code (an `Activity`).
  - **Latent Execution**: The `Call`'s output is generated by an LLM.

- **Module**: An external, reusable unit of logic (an `Activity` or an `Idea`) that can be invoked via a `Call` with a `Module Scope`. Signaled by the `_module` property.

- **Import**: A key that identifies a piece of context from the parent environment to be made available (`imported`) to an execution. It can be used to focus an LLM's attention in a **Latent Inline** execution or to construct the entire context for a **Module Scope** execution. Controlled by the `_imports` property.

- **State Message**: A context message containing a `state` object and an optional `schema`. It represents a persistent state maintained between ticks of an agent's execution loop.

- **Plan**: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) of `Tool Calls`. It defines a sequence of actions, with dependencies determined by tools reading from and writing to the `State Object`.

- **Plot**: A branching scenario within a `Plan` designed to handle unexpected or non-deterministic outcomes.

- **Instancing**: The process of handling multiple, independent `Instances` (each with its own `State Object` and unique identifier) within a single agent request.

- **Instance**: A single, uniquely identified state object and its associated context, processed as one of many within an `Instancing` operation.

- **Reactor**: A specific `Idea Transformer` designed as a universal runtime for stateful, turn-based agent interactions. It takes a game/process state (`Idea`) and produces the next state (`Idea`).
