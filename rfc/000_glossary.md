# Glossary of Terms

This document provides definitions for the key concepts used in the Idea Protocol and its related systems.

- **Idea**: A self-contained, stateful data triplet (`schema`, `solution`, `context`) representing a unit of knowledge. It's a persistent, computational primitive, not an ephemeral prompt.

- **Ideator**: An `Idea` that accepts input, signified by a context message of `type: "input"`. It acts as a function, transforming input to output.

- **Idea Transformer**: A specialized `Ideator` that takes another `Idea` as its input.

- **Input Message**: A context message containing a `schema` and `input` data. Its presence transforms an `Idea` into an `Ideator` by defining its expected inputs.

- **Tool**: A schema that defines a capability an agent can use. It is presented to an LLM as part of a request, acting as a structured interface for a potential action. The LLM activates the tool by generating a `Call` with specific parameters, which is then executed either latently by the LLM or explicitly by a registered code function (`Activity`).

- **Activity**: An explicit, deterministic code function that implements the logic for a `Tool`. It is the mechanism for executing actions that require external API calls, database operations, or any task that cannot be handled by an LLM's latent space.

- **Call**: A concrete, executable instance of a `Tool`, with specific values for its `params`. It's an invocation-focused request for what _should be done_.

- **Scope**: The locus of execution for a `Call`.
  - **Inline Scope**: The `Call` is processed in the current agent's context.
  - **Module Scope**: The `Call` is delegated to an external, isolated module.

- **Method**: The mechanism of execution for a `Call`.
  - **Explicit Execution**: The `Call`'s output is generated by deterministic code (an `Activity`).y an LLM.

  - **Latent Execution**: The `Call`'s output is generated by an LLM.

- **Module**: A protocol for isolating execution context. Invoked by a `Call`'s `_module` property, it executes an `Activity` or a new `Request` in a "clean room" environment, with the `_imports` property providing controlled access to the parent context.

- **Import**: A key that identifies a piece of context from the parent environment to be made available (`imported`) to an execution. It can be used to focus an LLM's attention in a **Latent Inline** execution or to construct the entire context for a **Module Scope** execution. Controlled by the `_imports` property.

- **Loop**: A sequence of `Request`s aimed at achieving a goal. The agent continues to invoke `Request`s, process the resulting `Call`s, and feed the output back into the context of the next `Request` until no more `Call`s are generated.

- **State Message**: A context message containing a `state` object and an optional `schema`. It represents a persistent state maintained between ticks of an agent's execution loop.

- **Process Idea**: A self-contained [Idea](./101_concept_idea.md) that captures a strategic [Plan](./012_agent_plan.md) and its live execution state. Its `schema` is the library of [Tools](./002_agent_tool.md), its `solution` is the _new_ `Plan` for the current tick, and its `context` contains the `Input`, `State`, and the previous `Plan`.

- **Vessel Idea**: A self-contained `Idea` that is both the definition of a reactive capability and the record of its chosen reaction. Its `schema` defines the full universe of possible `Tools`, and its `solution` captures the specific `Calls` (instances of those `Tools`) that were chosen in response to a stimulus.

- **Instancing**: The process of handling multiple, independent `Instances` (each with its own `State Object` and unique identifier) within a single agent request.

  > Sidenote:

  > - [011: Agent/Instancing](./011_agent_instancing.md)

- **Instance**: A single, uniquely identified state object and its associated context, processed as one of many within an `Instancing` operation.

- **Reactor**: A specific `Idea Transformer` designed as a universal runtime for stateful, turn-based agent interactions. It takes a game/process state (`Idea`) and produces the next state (`Idea`).
