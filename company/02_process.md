We stand at a crossroads. To move beyond the phase of exploration and truly achieve, uncover, and progress, we must invent and adhere to a disciplined process.

In a small team tackling a vast vision, reliance on traditional methods is a luxury we cannot afford. This protocol is not a constraint; it is the only mechanism that allows us to generate the necessary context, develop complex ideas, and ensure their successful execution. We commit to this process because it is the only way to make things work.

## 1. The Living Specification

> [!DEFINITION] Specification document
> The permanent, evolving source of truth that defines the product vision, architecture, and implementation details.

The creation and maintenance of the Living Specification is our primary work. It is not merely documentation; it is the codebase of our intent. This document provides the essential context and vision that aligns the team and guides the machine. It is designed to be updated frequently, serving as a useful, ever-present reference that grows in certainty and scope as we uncover the reality of what we are building.

- **Adherence to Truth:** We strictly follow the standards defined in :term[00: Company/Truth]{href="./00_truth.md"} to ensure every specification is self-contained, rigorous, and free from ambiguity. This context is mandatory for creating truly "living" documents.
- **Correctness over Speed:** Unlike transient documents, the Living Specification must be rigorously correct. It is better to leave a section undefined than to define it falsely. It is the foundation upon which all other work rests.
- **Expansion through Review:** The specification is never "finished," only "current." As we review it, we identify blind spots and missing dependencies. Addressing these expands the document's scope, not out of a desire for complexity, but to achieve the clarity required for execution.
- **The Destination:** This document describes _where we are going_. It allows every team member to understand the broader picture without needing to hold the entire plan in their head. It is the map we all agree to follow.

## 2. The Evolution Document

> [!DEFINITION] Evolution document
> A transient, rapid-response artifact used to align on changes, correct misconceptions, and provide context for execution before updating the Main Document.

Because the Living Specification is robust and permanent, changing it requires a mechanism for negotiation and course correction. The Evolution Document is that mechanism. It is a fast, focused instrument used to "echo back" our understanding of a problem, identifying miscommunications and specifying the exact approach we will take. It bridges the gap between human intent and LLM execution.

- **Adherence to Truth:** Like the Main Document, the Evolution Document relies on the standards in :term[00: Company/Truth]{href="./00_truth.md"}. We must be precise and assertive—stating clearly what is wrong and what will be done—to prevent the machine from acting on ambiguity.
- **Speed is Critical:** These documents must be created quickly—ideally on the same day the need arises. They are not labored over; they are optimized for immediate clarity and decision-making.
- **Synthesis of Misconception:** An Evolution Document is a correction vector. It explicitly states: "We thought X, but we learned Y, so we will do Z." It captures the blind spots revealed during discussions and converts them into a plan.
- **Context for the Machine:** LLMs require precise context to be effective. This document provides the "instruction prompt" for the machine, detailing the specific changes, the reasoning behind them, and the constraints. It ensures the AI works on the _current_ reality.
- **Options and Approaches:** This document is the place to propose different solutions or approaches for a specific problem. It allows the team to choose a path before significant effort is wasted on implementation.

## 3. The Cycle of Consensus

> [!DEFINITION] Pull Request
> The universal instrument for validating intent, refining meaning, and securing agreement on all artifacts—documents, plans, and code.

A Pull Request (PR) is not merely a mechanism for merging code; it is the crucible of shared understanding. It applies to every deliverable: from high-level visions and evolution documents to concrete implementation details. We use PRs to sign off on the _intent_ before the execution begins. It is the tool that transforms individual assumptions into collective certainty.

- **Beyond Code:** The PR process is valid for all work. We use it to agree on definitions, architectural plans, and strategic shifts. It is where "my idea" becomes "our plan."
- **Comments are Input, Not Chat:** Feedback on a PR is not a conversation thread to be answered one-by-one. It is raw data that must be synthesized.
- **Synthesize, Don't Argue:** The author must take all feedback and integrate it into a new iteration of the Evolution Document. This proves that the feedback was understood and addressed, stopping circular discussions.
- **Pre-Approval of Unpredictability:** By agreeing on the plan (the Evolution Document) first, we remove the surprise from the daily work. We know what is coming because we approved it.
- **Shared Responsibility:** When a team member approves a PR, they accept shared responsibility for the outcome. The author is no longer acting alone; they are executing a shared will.

## 4. The Ritual of Synchronization

> [!DEFINITION] 1-on-1 Calls
> High-frequency human touchpoints designed to unblock execution, answer questions, and maintain mutual trust.

We synchronize daily to prevent the drift that occurs when people work in isolation. These calls are not status updates—which can be read asynchronously—but active sessions for problem-solving and alignment.

- **Daily 10-Minute One-on-Ones:** A brief, high-intensity touchpoint with leadership to ensure the compass is still pointing true.
- **Preparation is Mandatory:** Participants must come with prepared topics. This ensures the time is used to solve actual problems, make decisions, or clarify the vision.
- **The Safety of Process:** This ritual eliminates the anxiety of the unknown. The leader confirms the direction is correct, and the team member confirms they have what they need to proceed. It builds the trust necessary to work autonomously without micromanagement.

## 5. The Role of the Machine

> [!DEFINITION] AI Augmentation
> The utilization of AI to amplify human intent, refine structure, and execute the details of the plan.

We use AI not to replace our thinking, but to enforce it. The machine is the lever; the Evolution Document is the fulcrum.

- **Dictate to Define:** We often dictate our raw thoughts to capture the nuance of intent, then use LLMs to structure that intent into a coherent Evolution Document.
- **Input for Execution:** The Evolution Document serves as the primary input for the LLM. If the document is clear, the LLM can generate code, tests, and updates to the Living Specification with high accuracy.
- **Verify the Output:** We judge the LLM's output against the standard defined in our documents. If the output is wrong, it is a failure of our specification, not the machine.

## 6. The Human Growth

> [!DEFINITION] Professional Evolution
> The acquisition of transferable skills for the AI era through the disciplined practice of document-driven collaboration.

Working directly with documents and strict processes is not administrative overhead; it is training for the future of work. This workflow places us in the shoes of AI architects and innovators, teaching us how to effectively direct intelligence—both biological and artificial.

- **Collaborating with AI:** By structuring our thoughts for machines, we learn the language of the future. We move from being "users" of AI to being "directors" of AI.
- **Transferable Experience:** The ability to articulate abstract intent into concrete specifications is the single most valuable skill in the AI industry. This work provides invaluable experience that will define our future careers.
- **Growth as Thinkers:** This process forces us to be rigorous, clear, and empathetic to the reader (human or machine). It fosters our growth as clearer thinkers and better colleagues.

## Summary

We trade the illusion of freedom for the reality of progress. By constraining _how_ we decide, we liberate _what_ we can achieve. We write to align, we align to trust, and we trust to execute.
