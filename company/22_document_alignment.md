## 1. The Core Philosophy

The Alignment Document is the **contract**. It summarizes the comments and decisions made during the Pull Request review of an :term[21: Proposal Document]{href="./21_document_proposal.md"}.

It is **Disposable**. It is a one-time artifact used to establish understanding and improve the process. It serves as the context for modifying the Proposal Document (to reflect agreed changes) and is the **Source of Truth for the Review**.

## 2. The Need

Why do we generate this document?

- **Synthesized Wisdom:** It converts a threaded conversation into a flat list of technical requirements. It filters out the noise and keeps the signal.
- **Dynamic Consensus:** It is not just a log; it is a workspace where the author and reviewer align on the _new_ plan that emerged from the discussion.
- **Machine Instruction:** It serves as the verified input for the AI to execute the changes.

## 3. The Process

1.  **Discussion:** Team discusses the :term[21: Company/Proposal]{href="./21_document_proposal.md"} in a Pull Request.
2.  **Generation:** An AI agent scans the comments and generates the Alignment Document (Time: ~5 mins via Prompt).
3.  **Refinement:** The author and reviewer use this document to confirm: "Yes, this is what we agreed to change."
4.  **Sign-Off:** Merging the Alignment Document signals "Consensus Achieved."
5.  **Update Proposal:** Use the Alignment details to update the Proposal Document (so tickets are accurate).
