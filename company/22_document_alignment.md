# 22: Company/Alignment

> [!DEFINITION] Alignment Document
> An auto-generated synthesis of the review process that captures shared consensus, resolved conflicts, and precise instructions for execution.

> Sidenote:

> - Part of: :term[02: Company/Process]{href="./02_process.md"}

## 1. The Core Philosophy

The Alignment Document is the **contract**. It summarizes the comments and decisions made during the Pull Request review of an :term[21: Proposal Document]{href="./21_document_proposal.md"}.

It is **Disposable**. It acts as a "context extractor," filtering the noise of the discussion into a clean set of actionable **Intents**. These intents serve as a **Validation Test**:

- Did we understand the feedback?
- Is the reaction to the feedback clear?

If the Alignment Document is accurate, the author uses it to **semi-automatically patch** the Proposal Document.

> [!WARNING] DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY & DO NOT COMMIT
> This document is **auto-generated**. If the Alignment Document is incorrect or fails to capture the nuance of the discussion, **do not edit it**. Instead, add clarification comments to the Pull Request and **regenerate** the document. This ensures the machine fully understands the context.
>
> **DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE.** This is a local validation artifact between the machine and the author. Only Proposals and Specifications are committed to the repository.

## 2. The Need

Why do we generate this document?

- **Test of Understanding:** It proves that the feedback loop is closed. If the AI cannot summarize the consensus correctly, it means the humans were not clear.
- **Local Verification:** It acts as a local test for the author to ensure the machine (and thus the team) has a complete understanding of the feedback before moving to execution.
- **Synthesized Wisdom:** It converts a threaded conversation into a flat list of technical requirements. It filters out the noise and keeps the signal.
- **Machine Instruction:** It serves as the verified input for the AI to execute the changes.

## 3. The Process

1.  **Discussion:** Team discusses the :term[21: Company/Proposal]{href="./21_document_proposal.md"} in a Pull Request.
2.  **Generation:** An AI agent scans the comments and generates the Alignment Document (Time: ~5 mins via Prompt).
3.  **Review (Self-Test):** The author reviews the generated Intents.
    - _Is the feedback captured?_
    - _Is the resolution correct?_
4.  **Patching:** The author uses the verified Alignment Document to update the :term[21: Company/Proposal]{href="./21_document_proposal.md"}. This ensures the Proposal remains the single source of intent.
5.  **Sign-Off:** Marking the PR as ready signals "Consensus Achieved." The Alignment Document is discarded, and the agreed changes are committed to the Proposal/Spec.

## 4. Structure

The Alignment Document (Review Summary) contains:

- **Overview:** High-level summary of the discussion (agreements, disagreements, insights).
- **List of Intents:** Atomic, granular technical tasks derived from the comments.
- **Coverage Report:** A mapping of every comment to a specific Intent, ensuring nothing was missed.
- **LLM Assessment:** An impartial analysis of the quality of the solution and the discussion.

## 5. Characteristics

- **Timeframe:** ~5 minutes to generate via Prompt.
- **Role:** Validation Test & Patch Source for the Proposal.
- **Nature:** Disposable / One-time use (Local Artifact).
- **Source of Truth:** **For the Review** (Consensus).
