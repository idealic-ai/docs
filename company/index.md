# Company Documentation

These documents articulate the operational core of our organization. They define the standards for communication, the protocols for execution, and the shared reality we commit to upholding. They are the source of truth for _how_ we work together.

This index bridges the gap between our abstract values and our daily actions. It serves as the manual for our collaboration, ensuring that every team member understands not just what we are building, but how we are building it.
