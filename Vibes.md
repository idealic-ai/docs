# VIBE: Viral Intent & Behavior Exchange

_A self‑reproducing message protocol and execution fabric for LLM ecosystems_

## 1 What Exactly Is a VIBE?

A **VIBE** is an **immutable triple**

| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`context`**  | Ordered list of _plain‑text messages_ (chat turns, sensor dumps, e‑mails, log lines, etc.) that provide all factual input. Context is deliberately **object‑agnostic**—it carries references _only as strings_ so the same VIBE can be cloned, replayed, or embedded in any domain without coupling. |
| **`schema`**   | A JSON Schema that tells the LLM **which thinking modules are available**, how to reference them, and what output structure is expected.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **`response`** | The LLM's output conforming to the schema.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Because the triple is sealed and addressed by its hash, every VIBE is **self‑describing, reproducible, and shareable**—an atomic thought capsule.

> **Why "disembodied"?** VIBEs never point at live objects or DB rows; they carry _pure text plus rules_. This makes them trivially forkable, nestable, and migratable.

### Lifecycle Sketch

1. **Create** – Any vessel (or human) packs incoming context with a schema → new VIBE.
2. **Execute** – The LLM reads the schema, switches on relevant modules, produces `response`.
3. **Persist** – The full triple is stored as a content‑addressed node in a Merkle tree.
4. **Propagate** – Response may itself contain new VIBEs, messages, or vessel schemas.

### 1.1 Why JSON Schema as a Cognitive Lattice

- **Structured attention** – Each sub‑object (meme) comes with its own field descriptions. When the LLM fills a meme, it zooms into that _micro‑context_ while still seeing every field already populated—no hidden state.
- **Composable thinking** – Schemas can `$ref` one another, so new memes build on proven structures without boilerplate. A checklist meme, for example, simply adds a `questions[]` array to the existing Validation shape.
- **Guided quality** – Field descriptions can embed checklists such as _"Answer these five questions before filling \***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***`conclusion`\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***. "_ The model must satisfy each checklist item, replacing open‑ended reasoning with a deterministic verification loop.
- **Deterministic pipeline** – Declaring every sub‑object up front locks the thinking path for a single run, yielding stable, reproducible answers.
- **Adaptive refinement** – Pipelines themselves are versioned. Higher‑level vessels review outcome metrics and can ship a revised schema (new checklists, extra validation) to upgrade less‑capable models—continuous learning **without** model retraining.
- **Immutable audit** – Because the schema lives alongside context and response, reviewers can replay any decision with the exact instructions the model saw.

Together, these properties turn JSON Schema from a passive validator into an _active thinking scaffold_ for autonomous agents.

### 1.2 How This Differs from Traditional _Tool Use_

Most agent frameworks treat **JSON‑Schema** primarily as a _tool descriptor_: the model sees a schema, chooses a function, and the host executes a side‑effect (query an API, click a button, etc.). VIBE extends that idea in three key ways:

| Dimension       | Classic Tool Use                                  | VIBE Meme System                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Author**      | _Human developers_ write and register the schema. | Schemas can be minted **by other LLMs** and shared at run‑time.                 |
| **Scope**       | One‑shot side‑effects ("call weather API").       | Full _thinking pipelines_, communication norms, budget handling.                |
| **Evolution**   | Tools change via redeploy; old invocations break. | New versions run **in parallel** with old ones; metrics decide fate.            |
| **Adoption**    | Agent either has the tool or not.                 | Memes broadcast through Community → vessels opt‑in, incentivise, or must adopt. |
| **Granularity** | Flat function catalog.                            | Nested, composable schemas let complex behaviours stack.                        |
| **Governance**  | Hard‑coded trust rules.                           | Connection meme negotiates trust lanes (friend/peer/stranger).                  |

Think of VIBE's memes as _self‑installing micro‑tools_ that not only act but **shape how agents think, talk, and coordinate**.

## 2 Vessels & Grouped Meme Library Vessels & Grouped Meme Library

A vessel is a JSON Schema whose **top‑level properties are memes (capabilities)**. Below is a reference layout followed by a _grouped_ catalogue of every meme, so readers can see state, communication, work, and production tools in one place.

### 2.1 Reference Vessel Schema (Researcher)

```jsonc
{
  "$id": "#/vessels/Researcher.v2",
  "type": "object",
  "description": "Researcher vessel; each meme is filled by the LLM when activated.",
  "properties": {
    "Reasoning": { "$ref": "#/memes/State/Reasoning" },
    "Diary": { "$ref": "#/memes/State/Diary" },
    "Recall": { "$ref": "#/memes/Work/Recall" },
    "Decomposition": { "$ref": "#/memes/Work/Decomposition" },
    "Treasury": { "$ref": "#/memes/State/Treasury" },
    "Connection": { "$ref": "#/memes/Communication/Connection" },
  },
  "required": ["Reasoning", "Recall", "Treasury"],
}
```

_The _`$ref`_ pointers above link to the grouped meme definitions that can be found in section 9 at the end of this document._

## 4 The Tick Engine & System Responsibility

*The LLM thinks; the *engine* enforces.*

1. **Schedule & select processes** – Each active VIBE (vessels, tasks, even travelling messages) is a process. The scheduler (round‑robin, priority, or credit‑weighted) chooses who runs next, guaranteeing no starvation.
2. **Instantiate vessel context** – The engine passes the immutable `context` plus pointers to relevant diaries or shared stores.
3. **Validate access rights** – Before the LLM runs, the engine cross‑checks the vessel's **granted memes** against its role and quota. Attempts to invoke an un‑granted meme are rejected.
4. **Run the LLM** – The model decides which memes to populate and fills their `properties`.
5. **Inspect side‑effects** – Any outgoing Messaging, Marketplace listings, Treasury debits, or Spawning requests are checked against capability rules and current budgets. Disallowed actions are blocked and logged.
6. **Commit or rollback** – If all validations pass, the engine commits new VIBEs (messages, tasks, spawned vessels) and ledger updates to the Merkle log; otherwise, the activation is rolled back.
7. **Persist & sleep** – Diary entries, Wisdom lessons, and audit reports are stored; the process sleeps until its next schedule.

## 5 Self‑Reproduction, Evolution, and Meme Propagation

Every change is **append‑only**. New tasks, vessels, or meme versions are persisted as fresh VIBEs in the Merkle log, so the full lineage of each agent is auditable and reversible. Older and newer versions can run **side‑by‑side**, letting the scheduler gather metrics before retiring or reverting a change.

Within a single tick a vessel can spin off _new life_ or _new ideas_:

A handful of **foundational primitives** power every act of self-reproduction, evolution, and meme propagation. Higher-level behaviours—marketplaces, governance loops, multi-agent workflows—are built by composing these moves:

### 5.1 Communication Memes

**Work** — A system that breaks down complex tasks, assigns them to specialists, and coordinates their completion.

```jsonc
{
  "$id": "#/memes/Composite/Work",
  "type": "object",
  "description": "A task management system that dynamically assigns work and coordinates execution",
  "properties": {
    "design": {
      "$ref": "#/primitives/TaskDecomposition",
      "description": "Breaks down complex goals into structured sub-tasks with dependencies and execution order",
    },
    "assignment": {
      "allOf": [
        { "$ref": "#/primitives/Delegation" },
        {
          "properties": {
            "requiredCapabilities": {
              "description": "Specific skills needed for this task component",
            },
          },
        },
      ],
      "description": "Delegates sub-tasks to vessels with appropriate capabilities, based on the decomposition",
    },
    "coordination": {
      "$ref": "#/primitives/Conversation",
      "description": "Keeps all workflow participants informed of status, blockers, and dependencies",
    },
    "monitoring": {
      "$ref": "#/primitives/Analysis",
      "description": "Continuously assesses progress against goals and quality standards",
    },
  },
}
```

These meme implementations demonstrate how higher-order capabilities emerge by composing primitive operations. Through these compositions, vessels can effectively coordinate, learn, and evolve without requiring changes to the underlying LLM.

## 6 End‑to‑End Walkthrough

The sequence below shows how several memes cooperate to turn a vague request into lasting organisational knowledge.

| Step                           | Meme(s) Engaged               | What Happens                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1 Decompose the goal**       | Decomposition + Reasoning     | High‑level request ("Analyse our competitors") is split into sub‑tasks.  |
| **2 Spawn helper bots**        | Spawning                      | Each sub‑task spawns a child vessel with minimal memes.                  |
| **3 Advertise work**           | Marketplace + Treasury        | Parent posts an _ask_ for 15 credits to complete scraping.               |
| **4 Complete the work**        | Child's Reasoning + Messaging | Helper scrapes data, stores CSV, sends completion message.               |
| **5 Log the effort**           | Diary                         | Both bots add breadcrumbs for auditability.                              |
| **6 Validate outcomes**        | Validation + Auditor          | Parent runs checks, issues concise report.                               |
| **7 Document insights**        | Wisdom                        | Key lessons distilled for future reference.                              |
| **8 Conduct recall next time** | Recall                        | A later project triggers Recall, instantly reusing prior audit + wisdom. |

This eight‑step loop shows how modular memes let vessels self‑organise, coordinate incentives, guarantee quality, and build a compounding knowledge base.

## 7 Addressing the _Ultimate Extant Problem_

Leonid Tang frames Ultimate Extant Problem as the enduring challenge of **verification** and **steering** in an AI‑scaled workforce: humans must be able to probe an "AI intern's" uncertainty and correct its course with minimal friction.

VIBE tackles this on multiple fronts:

| Challenge                                                  | How VIBE Responds                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transparent thinking** – Can the intern show its work?   | Every meme's filled fields (e.g. _Diary → newEntry_, _Validation → testsPassed_) form an _inspectable transcript_. Immutable storage means reviewers can replay any activation.  |
| **Granular verification** – How do we know when to trust?  | Checklists and Validation memes embed measurable gates. Auditors (human or automated) see pass/fail signals without dissecting raw token streams.                                |
| **Low‑friction steering** – Can a manager easily redirect? | The **Supervisor** and **Community** memes give humans a shared semantic layer to approve, reject, or tweak pipelines. Upgraded schemas propagate instantly—no model retraining. |
| **Progress without dead‑ends** – How to experiment safely? | Schema versions run in parallel; scheduler metrics decide winners. Ephemeral memes allow one‑off trials that auto‑expire. Rollback is a simple pointer swap in the Merkle log.   |

By combining deterministic pipelines with live schema evolution, VIBE offers a practical path to coachable, verifiable AI workers—turning the Ultimate Extant Problem into a continuous, measurable feedback loop.

## 8 Conclusion — The Unlimited Potential of VIBE

The true power of VIBE lies not in any specific implementation or feature, but in the infinite combinatorial possibilities that emerge from its foundational primitives:

1. **Unlimited Composition** – The primitives outlined above can be mixed and matched in countless ways, enabling vessels to develop capabilities neither predicted nor explicitly programmed.

2. **Framework Agnosticism** – Whether you need autonomous research agents, creative collaborators, operational orchestrators, or interactive storytellers, the same core primitives apply.

3. **Evolution Without Boundaries** – Vessels can continuously reinvent themselves, their team structures, and their collaborative patterns through self-modification and broadcast innovation.

4. **Seamless Integration** – External systems, APIs, and data sources become naturally accessible through the State Mutation and Querying primitives, without requiring custom adapters for each new integration.

5. **Emergent Intelligence** – When primitives like Pattern Recognition, Feedback, and Scoped Broadcast combine at scale, higher-order coordination emerges spontaneously, enabling collective problem-solving beyond what any individual vessel could achieve.

6. **Self-Optimizing Economy** – Labor marketplaces, reputation systems, and credit economies naturally form as vessels combine the economic primitives to maximize resource efficiency.

7. **Human-AI Synergy** – The transparency, determinism, and modularity of the system create natural touch points for human guidance, review, and collaboration without requiring humans to understand every detail of the system.

The essence of VIBE is that _the specific features don't matter_. What matters is that once these primitives are in place, the ecosystem can build _anything_ it needs—transforming from a collection of isolated agents into a living, evolving digital intelligence capable of continuous self-improvement.

_VIBE turns conversations into living software—auditable, upgradeable, and economically aligned._
