# Latent-Space Lego & Info-Hazards

**Date:** 2025-05-28
**Participants:** Diego Garrido, Yaroslaff Fedin
**Setting:** Friendly Telegram brainstorm on AI architecture, safety, and documentation practices

## Idea Log

- [Emergent] **Self-reflection might be an info-hazard** [InfoHazard] – Diego

  - Evolution — Yaro links this to “spiritual-bliss attractors” he’s seen LLMs hit after \~50 turns; frames it as a feedback loop that exploits human hunger for transcendence.
  - Explanation — _“It’s like a mirror that keeps folding back on itself until the signal gets dangerously loud.”_
  - Reactions — Diego: _“So funny to see the human weak point reflected… Could be a universal law of consciousness.”_

- **A single file can teach humans _and_ AIs via self-grading quizzes** [Quiz-DualDocs] – Yaro

  - Evolution — Markdown source includes human prose, `llm` blocks, ten-option quizzes; a script explodes multiple synced outputs.
  - Explanation — _“Docs that grade themselves—missed answers show me exactly where context is thin.”_
  - Reactions — Diego: _“Fun sci-fi linguistics… very clear—this looks like my consulting docs.”_
  - Data/Links — Example gist ([https://gist.github.com/Inviz/ca6bd86011b440291d305ed8af95b020](https://gist.github.com/Inviz/ca6bd86011b440291d305ed8af95b020)).

- **Build the platform from Lego-style bricks that snap together** [Modular-Lego] – Yaro

  - Evolution — Core bricks: hierarchies, prompts, processes, data; an **Experimentation** brick stress-tests any other.
  - Explanation — _“Picture a box of perfectly shaped Lego: solve each brick once, then recombine forever.”_
  - Reactions — Diego: _“Can’t wait to abuse the latent space with that.”_

- [Emergent] **Run risky variants inside parallel ‘pocket universes’** [Branching-Sandbox] – Yaro

  - Evolution — Branching layer spawns isolated sandboxes; results can merge or be discarded without polluting production.
  - Explanation — _“Think of Git branches for reality—safe forks you can nuke if they go rogue.”_
  - Reactions — Diego nods; no objections.

- [Emergent] **Price every bot action in tokens convertible to dollars** [Bot-Economy] – Yaro

  - Evolution — Bots earn, save, and buy autonomy; money becomes an internal metric dimension. Example cost: _\$3 per customer onboarding_.
  - Explanation — _“Compute-time today, matter-and-energy tomorrow—money is the bridge between virtual agents and the physical world.”_
  - Reactions — Diego: _“Exactly—compute is the ultimate currency until the Singularity flips to raw energy.”_

- [Emergent] **Evolve jailbreak-level prompts through metrics loops** [Prompt-SuperOpt] – Diego → Yaro

  - Evolution — Loop: harvest failing cases → mutate prompts → auto-score; repeat until edge-case coverage improves.
  - Explanation — _“Like genetic algorithms, but the gene is a weird, nonlinear prompt.”_
  - Reactions — Diego eager for tooling; worries humans may lose overview as optimisation accelerates.

- **Let AIs define and grade their own KPIs** [Metrics-System] – Yaro

  - Evolution — Uses LLM graders for softer criteria; supports nested optimisation loops for deeper tasks.
  - Reactions — Both debate single versus multi-loop setups; no conclusion yet.

- **Bottom-up tinkering beats top-down alignment** [Tinker-Alignment] – Diego & Yaro

  - Evolution — Consensus that rogue-AI incidents are likely within three years; tinkering framed as a KPI.
  - Reactions — Mutual skepticism of vague “alignment scare-tactic” narratives.

- [Emergent] **Use Alice–Bob banter to keep dense docs readable** [AliceBob-Docs] – Yaro

  - Evolution — Inserts Q\&A dialog between two semi-novice characters alongside specs; helps non-experts onboard.
  - Reactions — Diego: _“Feels like those notebook podcasts—nice way to ease people in.”_

- [Emergent] **Diffusion-text models could outpace token generators** [Diffusion-Text] – Diego

  - Evolution — Diego describes models that refine random word noise into coherent passages, analogous to image diffusion.
  - Explanation — _“Imagine watching gibberish morph into meaning instead of waiting for tokens to crawl out one by one.”_
  - Reactions — Yaro says that mirrors his own mental workflow: envision the whole, then zoom into parts.

## Promises

- Yaro will share results of **Quiz-DualDocs** experiments.
- Yaro will write a full “Statistics & Metrics” chapter covering **Metrics-System** in the upcoming manifest.
- Yaro will prototype hierarchy and process bricks first for **Modular-Lego**.
- Diego will “abuse the cognitive latent space” by trying these concepts in his biotech documents.

## Actionables

- Build a live demo where **Quiz-DualDocs** auto-grades and surfaces gaps.
- Draft and circulate the stability-focused interface spec for **Modular-Lego** bricks.
- Launch a minimal **Bot-Economy** sandbox with two agents trading services.

## Open Threads

- Which KPIs best drive **Prompt-SuperOpt** without heavy human oversight?
- How granular should **Branching-Sandbox** instances be to balance isolation with access to real-world data?
- What human-in-the-loop safeguards are needed if **InfoHazard** amplification worsens in agent swarms?
