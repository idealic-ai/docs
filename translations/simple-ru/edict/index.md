# A Declaration of Digital Independence

---

Imagine the internet today is like a giant kingdom ruled by just a few powerful kings. They own all the land, make all the rules, and get to say what happens.

This document is our big plan to change that. We want to help build a new kind of digital world where there are no kings. Instead, everyone gets to be the ruler of their own little plot of land. It's all about putting you and your friends back in charge of your own creations, messages, and online life.
