Imagine you have a magic seed. This isn't just any seed; it's a special package that contains everything needed to grow a specific, unique plant. We call this package an 'Idea'.

It’s not just a fleeting thought you have, but a solid, real thing you can hold, share, and build with. Inside every 'Idea' package, there are three key parts:

1.  **The Blueprint (or DNA):** This is called the `Schema`. It's a super-strict set of rules that describes what the final plant must look like. For example: "The flower must have five petals," or "The leaves must be green." This blueprint makes sure anyone (even a robot or AI) can understand exactly what the Idea is supposed to create.

2.  **The Ingredients & Instructions:** This is the `Context`. It’s all the materials and directions needed to grow the plant. It includes things like the soil, the water, and even stories or pictures that inspired this particular plant.

3.  **The Finished Plant:** This is the `Solution`. It's the final result! It’s the beautiful flower, the strong tree, or the delicious fruit that grew when you followed the blueprint using the ingredients.

### A Web of Living Things

Here’s the coolest part: the entire system is built only from these 'Idea' packages. There are no other hidden parts. And once an Idea is created, it can never be changed. It’s set in stone.

So, what if you want to make a small change, like making the flower blue instead of red? You don't edit the old Idea. Instead, you create a *new* Idea that links back to the original one. It’s like creating a child plant from a parent plant, creating a beautiful and clear family tree of how every thought evolved.

### More Than Just a Chat

You might think this sounds a bit like asking a chatbot a question. But it's much more powerful.

Asking a chatbot is like having a quick chat that’s immediately forgotten. An 'Idea' is different. It’s a permanent, reusable artifact. It’s not just the question you asked; it’s the question, the complete recipe for the answer, and the answer itself, all bundled together in one neat package. You can save it, share it, or even plug it into other Ideas to create bigger and more complex systems, all without writing a single line of computer code. It’s a building block, not just a conversation.

### The Golden Rules

To make sure this all works perfectly, every 'Idea' must follow four unbreakable rules:

1.  **Anyone Can Recreate It:** If you use the same Blueprint and the same Ingredients, you should always get a very similar Plant. The goal is to make it possible for anyone to trace the steps and see how a result was made.
2.  **No Hidden Pockets:** The AI that grows the plant can see everything in the package. You can't hide secret tools or instructions. Everything must be transparent.
3.  **The Blueprint is Law:** The finished Plant *must* perfectly follow the rules of its Blueprint. No exceptions! This keeps everything organized and predictable.
4.  **A Change Means It's New:** If you change the Blueprint or the Ingredients, even just a little bit, you have created a brand-new Idea. You can't alter an existing one.

### How Do You Find an Idea?

So, with all these Ideas floating around, how do you find one? Simple! Every single Idea gets its own unique address on the internet, just like a website (like `www.mycoolidea.com`).

This address acts as the Idea’s permanent identity. When you look up that address, a little signpost (called a DNS record) tells you exactly where on the internet the actual Idea package is stored. This means an Idea can be stored anywhere in the world, but you can always find it using its one, special name.
