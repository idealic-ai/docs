# The Grand Library of Blueprints

Imagine we're building a massive, super-cool city made of LEGOs. Before anyone can start building, we need to agree on the rules, right? We need blueprints that show exactly how every single piece should work.

That's what these documents are. We call them 'RFCs,' which is a fancy way of saying 'The Official Rulebook.' They are the master blueprints for our entire project. Every builder on our team uses this rulebook to make sure their part of the city fits perfectly with everyone else's.
