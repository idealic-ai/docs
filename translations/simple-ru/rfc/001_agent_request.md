Imagine you're talking to a super-smart robot chef who can make anything you want. A 'Request' is the special and very clear way you give the robot your order.

It’s not just shouting "Make a pizza!". A Request is like a complete recipe card that makes sure the robot chef (our AI) understands everything perfectly to create the final dish (we call this the `solution`).

### The Recipe-Making Steps

Making a Request is like an assembly line with a few steps:

#### 1. Context: Your List of Ingredients and Ideas

First, you give the robot all the background information, which we call the `context`. Think of it as a series of text messages that form a conversation. It's a list that might look like this:

- **Message 1 (from you to the robot):** "You are a world-class pizza chef."
- **Message 2 (from you to the robot):** "What's the best pizza to make for a party?"

This gives the robot its role and your question.

#### 2. Custom Content Types: Magical Ingredients

Now for the cool part! Sometimes, your messages aren't just plain text. You can include a "magical ingredient."

Instead of just writing "make it cheesy," you could give it a special object like `{ type: "SuperCheesy" }`.

When our system sees this magical ingredient, it's a secret code that automatically does a few things:

- **It adjusts the robot's settings:** Like telling the oven to get extra hot.
- **It updates the blueprint for the final dish:** It might add a new rule, like "The final pizza must have a perfectly golden, bubbly cheese topping."
- **It adds to the conversation:** It might add a new message for the robot, like, "Remember, the user wants this to be the cheesiest pizza ever!"

This lets us give very powerful instructions without having to write out long sentences every time.

#### 3. Schema: The Blueprint for the Final Dish

A `schema` is the blueprint. It tells the robot *exactly* what the final result must look like. It's a list of strict rules, like:

- The pizza must be a perfect circle.
- It must have exactly 8 slices.
- The only topping allowed is pepperoni.

Our system is smart and gives this blueprint to the robot chef in the best way possible:

1.  **The Best Way (Using Special Tools):** If the robot has a special pizza pan that is already a perfect circle with 8 slice-guides, we use that. It's the most reliable way to get what you want.
2.  **The Backup Plan (Using Regular Tools):** If the robot doesn't have the special pan, but has a generic "slicer" tool, we tell it: "Use your slicer tool to make 8 slices."
3.  **The Last Resort (Just Asking Nicely):** If the robot has no special tools, we just add to the instructions in big letters: "PLEASE MAKE SURE THE FINAL PIZZA IS A CIRCLE WITH 8 SLICES." We have to trust it to follow the directions.

#### 4. The Solution: Your Perfect Pizza!

After all the instructions and ingredients are prepared, the robot chef gets to work. It takes everything you've given it and produces the final dish.

This finished dish—which perfectly follows your blueprint—is the `solution`. It's a perfectly structured answer, ready to be served.

This whole process, from a simple idea to a perfect, rule-following result, is what makes a `Request` so powerful.
