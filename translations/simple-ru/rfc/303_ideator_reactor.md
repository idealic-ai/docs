### A Robot That Can Play Any Game

Imagine you built an amazing robot that was a world champion at poker. That's super cool! But what if you wanted it to play checkers, or even a brand new game you just invented? You'd have to rebuild it from scratch.

We had a system like that, which was an expert at poker. Now, we're changing it into something we call **'The Reactor'**. Think of The Reactor as a magical game board that can instantly learn and run *any* turn-based game you put on it. It doesn't matter if it's a game, a team project, or a pretend business—the board figures it out.

### The Secret: A Universal Language for Games

Our old system only spoke 'Poker Language.' To make our new Reactor work with any game, we needed a universal language. So we invented the **'Idea Card'**. Every single move in any game is described on one of these cards.

Each Idea Card has three parts:

1.  **The Rulebook (`Schema`):** This is like the game's instructions. It explains what the pieces are and what moves are possible right now. For example, 'It's your turn, and you can either draw a card or play a card.'
2.  **The Game Board (`Solution`):** This is a snapshot of what the game looks like right now. It shows where all the pieces are on the board.
3.  **The Secret Tips (`Context`):** This is extra information to help players make smart choices. It could be a history of past moves or helpful hints about other players.

With this Idea Card, anyone (or any robot) can look at the game board and instantly understand the rules and what they can do next, without needing to know the game beforehand.

### Two Kinds of Referees

The Reactor can run games in two different ways, using two kinds of referees.

**1. The Creative Referee**

What if you invent a brand new game? We have a super-smart AI that acts like a creative and clever friend. You can give it the basic rules on an 'Idea Card,' and it will referee the game, making sure everyone plays fair and figuring out what happens next. It's amazing because it can run *any* game, even one that's never been played before!

**2. The Expert Referee**

For games we know really well, like poker, we can use an Expert Referee. This is a computer program with the official rulebook coded right into it. It's lightning-fast and never makes mistakes. This expert can also act like a sports announcer, providing our robot players with cool stats and analysis (like 'this player bluffs 30% of the time!') to help them make even smarter moves.

### Learning the Rules by Playing

Here’s a revolutionary idea. Instead of writing a huge, complicated rulebook for a new game, we do something different. We just let the Creative Referee (our AI) play the game a bunch of times! We watch how it plays, see what makes the game fun, and find any weird situations. From all that playing, we learn what the best rules are and *then* we write them down. We get to test-drive the game before we even build the final version!

### Players That Remember Everything

Our robot players aren't like typical video game characters that reset after every level. Our players have a perfect memory. They are 'stateful,' which is a fancy way of saying they remember everything that's ever happened in every game they've played. They learn from their mistakes, remember your clever tricks, and get smarter over time, just like a real person.

### Why is this a Big Deal?

This new Reactor system is huge for us and our friends:

*   **Play New Games Instantly:** People can bring us a new game, and we can start having our smart robots play it on the very same day, even before we have an 'Expert Referee' for it.
*   **Help Invent a Game:** If someone has a complicated idea (like a new rewards system for a coffee shop), we can treat it like a game. The Reactor can simulate it, help them figure out the best rules, and make sure it works perfectly.
*   **Plug and Play:** Other people can design their own games and just plug them into our Reactor, and everything will just work.

### More Than Just Games

This magical game board is our first step toward a much bigger vision. We're creating a basic building block that can be used for almost anything. After all, if you think about it, almost everything is like a turn-based game: a conversation (I talk, then you talk), managing a project (we do step 1, then step 2), or even ordering a pizza.

This Reactor is like the first special LEGO brick in a giant new set. We can build other smart tools that connect to it—like a 'Fact-Checker' brick that adds useful info to an Idea Card, or a 'Coach' brick that analyzes it and gives advice.

By creating a system that can understand and play any game, we're really building a foundation to help smart AIs interact with the world in a more intelligent and useful way.
