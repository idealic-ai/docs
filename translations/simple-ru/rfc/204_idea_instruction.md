Imagine an **Instruction** is like a super-detailed recipe for a computer.

You know how a cookbook recipe tells you exactly what ingredients to use and what steps to follow to bake a cake? An Instruction does the same thing, but it's a recipe for changing a piece of information. It gives the computer a clear guide on *how* to make a change, a process we call `refine` (which just means to improve or edit something).

This 'recipe' is written in a very strict, computer-friendly language (called JSON Schema) so there's no confusion. It's like telling a robot 'use exactly 2 cups of flour,' not just 'use some flour.'

The best part is that these recipes are reusable, like LEGO bricks. You can use a simple one for a small task (like fixing a typo), or you can combine many of these little recipes to build a huge, complex set of steps (`Process`), like automatically rewriting an entire paragraph. They are the core building blocks for making any kind of change, big or small.
