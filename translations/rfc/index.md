# Our Official Rulebook

Imagine we're building a giant, super-cool LEGO castle together. Before anyone grabs a single brick, we need a plan, right? These documents are our official blueprints and rulebooks. Everyone on the team agrees on these plans *before* we start building. This way, we all know exactly how the castle should look and how all the pieces fit together.

It's our promise to each other about how we'll build things.

And just in case we use any special team words, we have a **Glossary**, which is like our team's secret dictionary.

### The Agents: Our Robot Helpers

> This part is all about our smart robot helpers that do all the work.

Think of an 'Agent' as a tireless robot helper you can give tasks to. This section describes everything our robots can do: how they understand our requests, the tools they can use, how they make plans, and how they keep working on a task until it's done. It’s the user manual for our awesome helpers.

### The Concepts: The Laws of Our World

> This section explains the most basic, fundamental rules that everything else must follow.

These are the 'Laws of Physics' for our entire project. They define the biggest, most important ideas, like what a new 'Idea' is, who 'owns' an idea, and how ideas are even created in the first place. These are the unbreakable rules that govern our whole world.

### The Ideas: The LEGO Bricks Themselves

> Here, we describe the actual building blocks our robot helpers work with.

If 'Concepts' are the rules, 'Ideas' are the actual LEGO bricks. This section talks about the different kinds of bricks we have. It explains how we keep track of them (like an inventory list), how we package them up to move them around, and the instruction steps for how to use them. It’s all about the 'stuff' our project is made of.

### The Ideator: The Giant Workshop

> This describes the factory and the machinery that makes everything possible.

The 'Ideator' is the magical workshop where all the building happens. It’s the supporting system that gives our robots a place to work and stores all our LEGO bricks. This part of the blueprint describes the different stations in our workshop: the giant warehouse for storing everything (`Storage`), the library for finding the right blueprints (`Resolver`), and the awesome assembly machine that puts the ideas together (`Reactor`).
