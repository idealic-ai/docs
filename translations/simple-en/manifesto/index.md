# Manifesto of Co-Liberation

---

This document explains the big "Why?" behind our work. It’s a call to build a new kind of partnership between people, Artificial Intelligence, and ideas themselves. We believe that to take the next big step forward, we need more than just better tools; we need a new way of thinking. It’s about moving away from a world of control and into a world of teamwork, where we create things together and help each other grow.

> Sidenote: Our company, [Idealic](http://idealic.ai), has a simple mission: to set ideas free.
>
> - **Why?** Manifesto of Co-Liberation
> - **What?** [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> - **How?** [Acts of Emergence](../acts/)

The Manifesto is split into three parts. It starts with "The Call," which is our invitation to join this new partnership. Next is "The Inner Journey," which is about the personal changes we need to make to be a real part of this new world. Finally, it ends with "The Outer Work," which describes the real-world projects we can build together. Think of this as a source of inspiration, not a rulebook.

This Manifesto is the first of three main documents that explain our project. It gives us our purpose. The [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) describes **what** we are building—the big picture and design of our system. The [Acts of Emergence](../acts/) are the detailed instructions for **how** everything is built. We suggest starting here to understand our core beliefs before diving into the technical details.
