# 20: Company/Specification

> [!DEFINITION] Specification
> Imagine a master blueprint for a project. It’s the one, single guide that explains the big idea, how all the parts fit together, and the exact details for building it. This blueprint is never finished; it grows and gets better as the project does.

## 1. The Main Idea

The Specification is the ultimate goal. Think of it like a beautiful piece of art you work on for a long time. It’s something the creator builds, improves, and constantly updates. You can't make it in a single day; it's the result of weeks of deep thinking and many drafts.

It’s always kept fresh and up-to-date. It is the **one single source of truth** for everything in the project (the code, the design, and the plan). When you're building something really complicated with a team, you can't just rely on what people remember from chats. You need one reliable guide that everyone follows.

**The Big Dream:** We hope that if we make this blueprint detailed and perfect enough, computers will eventually be able to do a lot of the work for us, like writing code or creating designs. We’re writing this so that one day, a machine can read it and understand what to do.

## 2. Why We Need It

Why do we spend so much time on this document?

- **To Be Clear and True:** The guide must follow the rules for being truthful, as explained in :term[00: Company/Truth]{href="./50_prompt_truth.md"}. Everything you need to know should be in this one place, with no room for confusion.
- **Be Right, Not Fast:** Quick notes or early plans can have mistakes, but this document has to be 100% correct. It's much better to leave a part blank and say "we don't know this yet" than to write down something that's wrong.
- **It's a Map:** This document shows everyone where the project is going. It lets every team member see the big picture without having to memorize the entire plan.
- **To Handle Big Projects:** For huge projects with many different parts, it's impossible for one person to remember how everything works. The Specification acts like the project's memory, allowing it to grow and change without becoming a mess.

## 3. Rules for Keeping It Current

1.  **Always Update It:** If the code changes, the document must change. Ideally, the document should be updated *before* the code is changed.
2.  **It Grows as We Learn:** The document is never really "finished," it's just "up-to-date for now." Each time we review it, we find things we missed. Filling in those gaps makes the document bigger and clearer, so it's easier to build things the right way.
3.  **The Document is the Boss:** If the code does something different from what the document says, then the code is wrong and has a bug. The document is the final authority. (If the document itself needs to be changed, there's a special process for that.)

## 4. One Plan, Many Uses

The "project" isn't always about code. The plan changes based on what we're making:

| Area | The Plan (The Truth) | The Final Product (The Result) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Code** | A detailed blueprint for how the software is built | The final, working program |
| **Storytelling** | A complete script or outline | The finished slideshow or video |
| **Teamwork** | The team's official rulebook | How everyone works together every day |
| **App Design** | Sketches of how you'll use the app | The actual buttons and screens in the app |

## 5. Quick Facts

- **How long does it take?** Weeks to create, and it's updated forever.
- **How many tries?** Many drafts and improvements.
- **Its job:** It is the main, most important document that holds the whole project together.
- **How it lives:** It's always kept fresh and up-to-date.
- **What it is:** The one true guide for how the entire system works.
