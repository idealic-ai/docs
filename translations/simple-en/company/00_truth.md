## 1. The Document is the Final Word

When we write an official document, it means a **decision has been made**. It’s not just a conversation.

- **The 'Why' Comes First:** Before we figure out *how* to do something, we must know exactly *why* we're doing it. This 'why' is the only way to know if we've succeeded.
- **Make a Choice:** The goal isn't to list all the possible options, but to pick one. If we can't decide, we must write down exactly what we need to learn before we can.
- **Facts, Not Hype:** Never bend the truth to make something sound better ("Do Not Lie") and don't try to sell an idea ("Do Not Sell"). The only thing that matters is being accurate.
- **The Complete Recipe:** The main document must have every single detail, even the complicated parts. Think of it as the master recipe. We can create simpler versions for other people later, but the original must be perfect and complete.
- **Always Up-to-Date:** Documents are like living maps. If the plan changes, the document is the first thing we update.
- **Zero Confusion:** A finished document should have no unanswered questions or fuzzy spots. If someone reads it and is confused, the document has failed.
- **Focus on What’s Right:** We don't write about old mistakes. Instead of explaining why a past idea was wrong, we just state what is correct now. Show the truth, not the journey of fixing errors.

## 2. Straight Lines & Clear Connections

Writing is how we find the bugs in our own ideas.

- **A to B to C:** Explain things in a straight line, from start to finish. If you have to jump back and forth, it probably means your idea is tangled up, like a knotted shoelace.
- **Untangle the Knots:** Work on your ideas until each part can be explained simply, one after the other. If you have an idea that is a real loop (like a circle), draw a diagram so people can see the whole loop at once.

## 3. Why We Write Before We Build

Writing things down is hard work, but we do it first because **we can't just start building**. Making a website, an app, or even a presentation is like building with something that's hard to change once it's made. Writing lets us find and fix problems before the expensive work begins.

- **Pre-Thinking:** A good document is like sorting all your building blocks by color and size before you begin. It turns messy thoughts into a clear plan that can easily become code, slideshows, or step-by-step guides.
- **Break It Down:** Big ideas need to be broken into smaller pieces. If a document gets too big and complicated, we split it into smaller, more focused documents, just like you’d organize a big project into smaller tasks.

## 4. Making Sure It Makes Sense

To make sure our writing can be turned into real action:

- **Separate Facts from Guesses:** Don’t mix what you know for sure with things you're still exploring. Keep firm decisions in one section and questions in another.
- **Be Clear About Time:** Use a 'now' tense for how things work today ("The system *checks* the password"). Only use a 'future' tense for plans that aren't built yet. Never mix them in the same thought.
- **Examples Are Everything:** Every big idea must be followed by a real-world example. Ideas without examples are just daydreams.
- **Use Real Numbers, Not Fuzzy Words:** Avoid vague words like "fast," or "easy to use." State facts that can be proven wrong or right ("It loads in under 1 second," "it has a flat design," "it takes 3 clicks at most").
- **Draw the Line:** It’s just as important to say what a system *doesn’t* do. Knowing the limits is as important as knowing the features.

## 5. Building with Ideas

We create documents to be like individual building blocks that can be put together in new ways.

- **One Topic, One Document:** A single document shouldn't try to explain everything. It should focus on one area perfectly, so it can be combined with other documents to solve bigger problems.
- **Creating New Things:** The real magic happens when you combine documents. Mixing a technical guide with a new feature idea can spark a brand new plan.
- **Made for Computers to Read:** We organize our documents so that computers and AI can understand them. AIs are great at connecting clear ideas, so our job is to give them clean, high-quality building blocks to work with.

## Summary

We write to make our ideas clear. We write to stick to the facts. We write to create.

## Appendix: Our Voice and Style

We write by stating things directly and cutting out all the fluff.

1.  **Start in the Middle:** Jump right into the problem. **Avoid:** Long introductions like "In today's fast-paced world..." or explaining beginner stuff.
2.  **Be Confident:** Say what something *is*. Make a clear statement. **Avoid:** Saying "it depends" without explaining what it depends on.
3.  **Lead with the Idea:** Let one thought flow naturally into the next. **Avoid:** Saying things like "Now, let's look at..." Just look at it!
4.  **Let Logic Speak:** Make your point so clearly that it doesn't need fancy words. **Avoid:** Citing "experts" or using adverbs like "critically" to make something sound important.
5.  **Be Specific and Casual:** Use simple, clear language, like you're explaining something to a smart friend. **Avoid:** Stiff, corporate words like "utilize" or "leverage."
6.  **Trust the Reader:** If your ideas are in order, people will follow along. **Avoid:** Over-explaining or adding summaries where they aren't needed.
7.  **Focus on the Problem:** Talk about the challenge itself, not the type of person who has it. Get straight to the point.
8.  **Respect Your Reader:** Assume the person reading is smart and responsible. **Avoid:** Telling them what to think or adding unnecessary warnings.
