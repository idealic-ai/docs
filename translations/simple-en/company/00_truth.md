# 00: Company/Writing Standard

> Our Rule
> These rules make sure our documents are the ultimate source of truth. They must be perfectly clear, logical, and written by a human, not a confused robot.

## 1. A Document is the Truth

A document isn't a conversation; it's a **final choice**.

- **The Goal Comes First:** First, figure out *what* you're trying to do. Only after that can you think about *how* to do it. The 'what' is your goal, and it's the only way to know if you've succeeded. Don't mix it up with the steps you take to get there.
- **Make the Call:** The point of a document is to state a final decision, not to list all the options. If you're stuck and can't decide, the document should clearly explain what information you're missing.
- **Be Accurate, Not Convincing:** Don't hide the complicated parts (that's like lying), and don't try to 'sell' an idea with fancy words. Just state the facts. Truth is the only thing that matters.
- **The Master Blueprint:** The main document—our source of truth—needs to contain every single detail, even if it uses tricky technical words. We can make simpler versions for others later, but the original must be complete.
- **Always Up-to-Date:** Our documents are alive. If our plan changes, the document must be the very first thing that gets updated.

## 2. Clear Order and Connections

Writing helps us find mistakes in our own ideas. It's like debugging a computer program, but for our brain.

- **A to B to C:** Explain things in order, from beginning to end. If you have to keep jumping back to explain something you mentioned earlier, it means your idea has a tangled loop, like a hose that’s been knotted up.
- **Untangle the Knots:** Unravel messy, circular ideas so each part can be understood on its own. If you have a loop you just can't get rid of—like the chicken and the egg—draw a picture of it. A diagram can show the whole loop as one single, understandable thing.

## 3. Why This Helps Us Work

Writing documents is hard work, but we do it first for a good reason. You can't just start building something complicated without a plan. Writing code is like using paint that dries instantly—it’s hard to make big changes. Writing is our chance to figure everything out with a pencil before starting the expensive, permanent work.

- **Thinking Ahead:** A great document is like doing all your thinking ahead of time. It takes a messy cloud of ideas and turns it into an organized plan. This plan can then be easily turned into real things, like code or presentation slides.
- **Break It Down:** You have to break big ideas into smaller pieces. If a document gets too long and complicated, it should be split into several smaller, focused documents, just like you’d break a huge program into smaller parts.

## 4. Keeping the Content Honest and Clear

To make sure a document is useful and perfectly clear:

- **Separate Facts from Guesses:** Keep what you *know* separate from what you're *not sure about*. Make it obvious which parts are final decisions and which parts are still just ideas we need to explore.
- **Be Clear About Time:** When you describe how something works, use the present tense (like 'The app *checks* the password'). Only use the future tense ('The app *will check* fingerprints') for things we plan to build later. Don't mix them together.
- **Always Give an Example:** Every time you talk about a big, general idea, you must immediately give a real, specific example. An idea without an example is just a daydream that can cause confusion.
- **Use Testable Facts:** Don't use fuzzy words like 'fast' or 'easy to use.' Instead, give specific, testable rules. For example, instead of 'fast,' say 'loads in less than one second.' That way, we can actually measure if we succeeded.
- **Draw the Line:** Clearly state what your system or idea *doesn't* do. Knowing the limits is just as important as knowing what it can do. It's like drawing the border on a map so everyone knows where it ends.

## 5. Making Documents That Work Together

We write our documents like ingredients for a recipe. Each one is a simple, separate part that can be combined with others to create something new.

- **One Thing at a Time:** One document shouldn't try to explain everything. Each document should focus on just one topic. You solve big problems by combining these different 'ingredient' documents.
- **Mix and Match:** The real magic happens when you combine documents. Mixing a `Tech Guide` with a `New Feature Plan` can help you invent new solutions or explain an idea to a specific person instantly.
- **Write for the Robots:** We organize our documents so computers, especially advanced AI, can understand them. An AI is great at snapping these 'ingredient' documents together to create a big, clear picture of the truth for us.

## Summary

We write to think clearly. We write to stick to the facts. We write to build great things.

## Appendix: Our Style Guide

We write by being direct and avoiding fluffy, robotic-sounding language.

1.  **Get Straight to the Point:** Start with the actual problem. **Don't:** Give a history lesson or explain things everyone already knows.
2.  **State Facts, Don't Guess:** Say what something *is*. Make a clear statement. **Don't:** Say "it depends" without explaining what it depends on.
3.  **Let the Idea Lead:** Connect your thoughts smoothly. **Don't:** Say things like "Now, let's look at..." or "It is important to note."
4.  **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Let your logic and facts make the point. **Don't:** Just say your idea is good because it's an "industry standard" or add words like "Clearly..." to sound more important.
5.  **Be Specific and Normal:** Use simple, clear descriptions. Talk like a real person. **Don't:** Use stiff, corporate words like "utilize" or "leverage."
6.  **Trust Your Flow:** Let one idea naturally lead to the next. **Don't:** Use titles like "Summary" at the end of every section.
7.  **Focus on the Problem:** Talk about the core challenge, not who it affects. Just explain the situation and what's at stake.
8.  **Talk to an Equal:** Assume the person reading is smart and responsible. **Don't:** Preach or add unnecessary warnings.
