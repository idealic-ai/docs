# 00: Our Guide to Writing

> The Rulebook
> This guide is our promise that every document we write is the single source of truth—clear, logical, and without any confusing robot-speak.

## 1. A Document is a Decision

When we write a document, we are making a final decision, not just talking about possibilities.

- **Goal First, Method Second:** We have to agree on exactly _what_ we want to do before we figure out _how_ to do it. This goal is our only measure of success, and it must be kept separate from the details of building it.
- **Make a Choice:** The point isn't to list all the options, but to pick one. If we can't decide, we must write down exactly what information we need to make that choice.
- **Facts, Not Fluff:** Never hide how complex something is just to make it sound easy. And never use persuasive language to try and sell an idea. The only thing that matters is being accurate.
- **All the Details:** The main document—our source of truth—must contain all the necessary details, even the complicated bits. It's okay to use expert terms to be precise. We can always create simpler versions for other people later, but the original must be complete.
- **Always Up-to-Date:** Think of our documents as living blueprints. If a plan changes, the document is the very first thing that gets updated.

## 2. Straight Lines and Untangled Knots

Writing helps us find the flaws in our ideas. The act of writing is how we debug our own thinking.

- **Tell a Straight Story:** Explain your idea from start to finish. If you find yourself jumping back and forth, it’s a big clue that your idea has tangled parts that depend on each other in a confusing circle.
- **Untangle the Knots:** Rework those circular ideas until each part makes sense on its own. If a concept is so tangled that you can't separate the parts, draw a diagram of it. A picture can show the whole messy loop as one simple shape.

## 3. Why We Write First

Writing is hard work, but we do it before anything else. It's because you can't just jump into building something complex without a plan. Things like computer code or a final presentation are hard to change once you've started making them. Writing forces us to figure out all the confusing parts *before* we get to the expensive and difficult stage of actually building.

- **Thinking Ahead:** A good document is like doing all the hard thinking for a project upfront. It takes a jumble of ideas and organizes them into a clear plan that can easily be turned into code, a slideshow, or a set of rules.
- **Break It Down:** Big ideas are easier to handle in small pieces. If one document becomes too big and complicated, we split it into several smaller, simpler ones—just like a programmer breaks a giant program into smaller parts.

## 4. How We Sound

Our writing style is simple: get straight to the point and avoid the fluffy, vague language that sounds like it was written by a boring robot.

1.  **Get Right to It:** Jump straight into the specific problem. **Don't start with:** big, general statements like, “In today’s fast-paced world…” or explaining really basic stuff.
2.  **Be Confident, Not Vague:** State clearly what something *is*. **Don't say:** “It depends” without explaining exactly what it depends on.
3.  **Let Ideas Flow:** Connect your thoughts naturally. For example, say, “This causes another problem…” instead of, “Now, let’s look at the next section…”
4.  **Explain Why:** Your logic should be strong enough on its own. **Don't say:** something is good just because “everyone does it” or try to make it sound important by adding words like “crucially.”
5.  **Be Clear and Normal:** Use simple, everyday words. Talk like a real person explaining something to a friend. **Don't use:** stuffy, corporate words like “utilize” when you can just say “use.”
6.  **Connect Your Paragraphs:** Make sure your writing flows smoothly from one idea to the next so you don't need to add signs like “In conclusion…”
7.  **Focus on the Problem:** Talk about the situation or the need itself, not the type of person who has the problem. Explain what's at stake right away.
8.  **Trust Your Reader:** Assume the person reading is smart. **Don't:** give them moral lectures or add unnecessary warnings.

## 5. Keeping It Real

To make sure our documents are useful and impossible to misunderstand:

- **Separate Facts from Guesses:** Keep the things you've decided on separate from the things you're still exploring. Clearly mark what is a firm plan and what is still a question.
- **Use the Right Tense:** When describing how something works, use the present tense (e.g., “The system *checks* the password”). Only use the future tense (“The system *will check*…”) for plans you haven't built yet. Never mix the two in the same thought.
- **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Whenever you explain a big, abstract idea, immediately give a specific example to show what you mean. Without an example, an idea is just a daydream.
- **Use Real Numbers, Not Vague Words:** Avoid fuzzy words like “fast” or “easy.” Instead, use specific goals that can be tested, like “loads in under 1 second” or “takes less than 3 clicks.”
- **Say What It *Doesn't* Do:** It’s just as important to explain the limits of a system as it is to explain what it can do. A boundary is a key part of the design.

## In a Nutshell

We write to make our thinking clear. We write to hold ourselves to the truth. We write so we can build great things.
