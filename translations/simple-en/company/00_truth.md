# 00: Company/Our Writing Rules

> Our Rulebook
> This is our official guide to make sure everything we write is the absolute truth—clear, logical, and without any confusing robot-speak.

## 1. The Document is the Final Say

When we write something down, it's a final **decision**, not just a chat about ideas.

- **The Goal Comes First:** We must be crystal clear about *what* we want to do before we figure out *how* to do it. The goal is our only measure of success, and it's separate from the steps we take to get there.
- **Make a Choice, Don't Just List Options:** The point is to make a decision, not to talk about all the possibilities. If we can't decide, we must write down exactly what information we're missing.
- **Be Accurate, Not Convincing:** Never over-simplify things just to make them sound easy (that's like lying). And never use fancy words to try and sell an idea. Being perfectly correct is all that matters.
- **The Master Copy Has Everything:** The main document—our source of truth—must include every single detail, even the complicated bits. We can create simpler versions for others later, but we never dumb down the original.
- **Always Up-to-Date:** Think of our documents as living instruction manuals. If an idea changes, the document is the very first thing we update.
- **No Unanswered Questions:** A finished document should have zero confusion. If you read it and have questions, the document has failed. It needs to be totally clear and confident.
- **Just State the Truth:** We don't write about our past mistakes. Instead of explaining why an old idea was wrong, we just focus on explaining what is correct right now. Present the truth, not the history of how we got there.

## 2. Straight Lines & Clear Connections

We write things down to find the flaws in our own ideas. The act of writing is how we fix our thinking.

- **Explain in Order:** An explanation should flow from start to finish, like telling a good story. If you have to keep jumping back and forth to explain things, it probably means the idea itself is a tangled mess.
- **Untangle the Knots:** We work to fix ideas that go in circles until they make a straight line. If an idea is truly a loop that can't be untangled, we draw a **Diagram** of it so people can see the whole loop at once.

## 3. Why We Write First

Writing documents is hard work. We do it first because **you can't just jump into building something big**. Whether you're writing code, making a presentation, or creating rules for a game, the final product is hard to change. Writing is like drawing a blueprint—it forces us to solve problems before we start the expensive and difficult work of building.

- **Thinking Ahead:** A good document is like having all your thoughts organized ahead of time. It turns a messy idea into a clear plan that can easily be turned into **real things** (like code, slides, or instructions).
- **Break It Down:** You have to break big ideas into smaller pieces. If a document gets too long, we split it into smaller, focused documents, just like you'd break down a giant project into smaller tasks.

## 4. Keeping Our Writing Clear and Honest

To make sure our documents are useful and easy to understand:

- **Separate Facts from Guesses:** Don't mix things you've decided on with things you're still exploring. It's important to clearly mark what is a firm decision and what is still being figured out.
- **Use the Right Tense:** Talk about the system in the present tense ("The system *checks* the password"). Only use the future tense for things we plan to build later. Never mix them in the same sentence.
- **Give Real Examples:** Every big idea must be immediately followed by a real-world example. An idea without an example is just a daydream.
- **Be Testable:** Avoid fuzzy words like "fast," "big," or "easy." Instead, use descriptions that can be proven true or false (like "loads in under 1 second," "doesn't remember users between visits," or "takes 3 clicks at most").
- **Say What It's Not:** Explain what your system *doesn't* do. Knowing its limits is just as important as knowing what it can do.

## 5. Building with Ideas

We write our documents like they are building blocks, made to be combined.

- **One Document, One Job:** A single document should focus on one topic and one topic only. It doesn't try to explain the whole world. It becomes powerful when you combine it with others.
- **Mix and Match to Create:** You find new solutions by putting different documents together. For example, mixing our "Tech Rules" document with a "New Feature Idea" document creates a perfect plan for building that feature.
- **Write for Helpful Robots:** We structure our writing so that computers and AI can understand and combine our ideas. Our job is to make perfect, clear building blocks that an AI can then assemble into bigger truths.

## Summary

We write to make our ideas clear. We write to stick to the facts. We write to build great things.

## Appendix: Our Voice

We write by being direct and cutting out all the fluffy, useless words.

1.  **Get Straight to the Point:** Start with the problem right away. **Don't:** Start with boring introductions like "In today's world..."
2.  **Be Confident:** State what something *is*. Make a clear point. **Don't:** Say "it depends" without explaining on what, or only describe what something *isn't*.
3.  **Let Ideas Flow:** Connect your thoughts logically. **Don't:** Use announcements like "Now, let's look at..." or filler like "It's important to note..."
4.  **Show Your Work:** Let your logic make the point for you. **Don't:** Justify things by saying "it's a best practice" or by adding words like "Obviously..."
5.  **Be Clear and Casual:** Use plain, simple language. Talk like a real person. **Don't:** Use stiff, corporate words like "utilize" or "leverage."
6.  **No Need for Road Signs:** Your writing should flow so well that one paragraph naturally leads to the next. **Don't:** Use labels like "Introduction" or "Conclusion."
7.  **Focus on the Problem:** Talk about the challenge itself, not the people who have it. Describe the situation and what's at stake.
8.  **Trust Your Reader:** Assume the person reading is smart and doesn't need to be babied. **Don't:** Give them unnecessary warnings or lectures.
