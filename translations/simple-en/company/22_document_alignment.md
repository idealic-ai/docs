# 22: Company/Alignment

> [!DEFINITION] Alignment Document
> A summary that a computer automatically creates after a team discussion. It writes down what everyone agreed on, how they solved disagreements, and gives clear instructions on what to do next.

> Sidenote:
> - Part of: The team's official way of working, the :term[02: Company/Process]{href="./02_process.md"}
> - Made by: An AI using a :term[51: Prompt/Alignment]{href="./51_prompt_alignment.md"}
> - Happens Before: Updating the final blueprint, the :term[20: Company/Specification]{href="./20_document_spec.md"}

## 1. What It's For

The Alignment Document is like a **contract**. It summarizes all the comments and decisions the team made when they reviewed a new idea, which is called a :term[21: Proposal Document]{href="./21_document_proposal.md"}.

It’s also **disposable**, meaning you throw it away after you use it. It acts like a filter for a conversation, taking all the messy back-and-forth talk and turning it into a clean list of simple instructions, which we call **Intents**. These instructions are used as a quick check:

- Did we correctly understand what everyone said?
- Is our plan for what to do next perfectly clear?

If the Alignment Document is correct, the person who wrote the original idea uses it to help the computer **automatically update** the main plan.

> [!WARNING] DON'T EDIT THIS BY HAND & DON'T SAVE IT
> This document is made by a computer. If it's wrong or misses an important point from the discussion, **do not fix it yourself**. Instead, go back to the original conversation, add more comments to make things clearer, and tell the computer to **make a new one**. This makes sure the computer really understands what the team decided.

> **DO NOT SAVE THIS FILE** to the main project. It's just a temporary tool for the author and the computer to check their work. Only the official Proposals and final plans get saved permanently.

## 2. Why We Need It

Why do we have the computer make this document?

- **To Check Our Understanding:** It proves that we're all on the same page. If the AI can't write a good summary, it's a sign that the people in the discussion weren't being clear enough.
- **A Quick Personal Check:** The author can use it to double-check that the computer (and therefore the whole team) understood all the feedback before they start working on the changes.
- **Clear Instructions:** It turns a long conversation into a simple to-do list. It gets rid of all the extra talk and just keeps the important action items.
- **A Recipe for the Computer:** Once everyone agrees the summary is right, it becomes the set of instructions the AI uses to make the changes to the plan.

## 3. The Process

1.  **Talk:** The team discusses a new :term[21: Company/Proposal]{href="./21_document_proposal.md"} online.
2.  **Summarize:** An AI reads all the comments and creates the Alignment Document (this takes about 5 minutes).
3.  **Review:** The person who wrote the original idea reads the computer’s summary to see if it’s right.
    - _Did it include all the feedback?_
    - _Are the solutions the right ones?_
4.  **Update:** The author uses the approved summary to update the original :term[21: Company/Proposal]{href="./21_document_proposal.md"}. This makes sure the Proposal is always the one true source for the plan.
5.  **Finish:** Once everyone agrees the plan is ready, the Alignment Document is thrown away. The final, agreed-upon changes are saved to the official plan.

## 4. What's Inside

The Alignment Document contains:

- **Overview:** A quick summary of the conversation—what people agreed on, disagreed on, and any new discoveries.
- **To-Do List:** A list of small, specific tasks based on the comments.
- **Checklist:** A report that shows how every single comment was turned into a task, so we know nothing was forgotten.
- **AI's Opinion:** A fair review from the AI about how good the final plan is and how well the team discussed it.

## 5. Key Facts

- **How long to make?** About 5 minutes, using an AI command.
- **What's its job?** To check everyone's understanding and to help update the main plan.
- **How long does it last?** It's temporary. You use it once and then get rid of it.
- **What is it the official record of?** The **Team's Agreement**.
