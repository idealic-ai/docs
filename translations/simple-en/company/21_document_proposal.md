# 21: Company/Proposal

> [!DEFINITION] Proposal Document
> A temporary document used to sketch out an idea for a change or a new feature before anyone starts building it.

## 1. The Core Idea

A Proposal is basically like sending a message that says, “I have an idea, what does everyone think?” You write it **once** at the beginning of a new project to kick things off. We need it because we can’t figure out a big, complicated plan all at once. We have to break the problem into smaller steps. One Proposal is like **one chapter** in the project's story.

We **save it forever**. It becomes the official history of why we decided to change things and acts as the **main guide for our original goal**.

## 2. Why We Need It

Why write a plan instead of just starting to build?

- **Getting Past the Blank Page:** We can't build a machine that reads our minds. A Proposal forces us to pull our thoughts out and put them into words. The best way to start is often to just **talk about the idea out loud** and write down what you say.
- **Creating a To-Do List:** This document is the starting point for all the small tasks the builders (engineers) will work on. It makes sure the work is broken down into small, clear steps (like tasks that take about a day).
- **Keeping Ideas Separate:** It separates “What we want to do” from “How we’re going to do it.” This lets us discuss whether the idea is good without getting stuck in the technical details.
- **A Safe Place to Experiment:** It lets us suggest wild, new ideas without messing anything up. If a Proposal is rejected, all you lose is a text file. Nothing breaks.
- **Giving Instructions to a Computer:** Smart computers (like AI models) need very clear instructions to help out. This document serves as the main instruction manual for both the computer and the human team.

## 3. The Structure (A Template)

A Proposal follows a clear, story-like structure to make sure the idea makes sense and is safe to build. The sections below are the **standard parts**, but you can change them if another structure tells the story better.

### 3.1. The backstory (How We Got Here)

_The Story:_ “We used to think X, but then we learned Y, so now we have to do Z.”

1.  **What We First Believed:** What was our original assumption?
2.  **The Turning Point:** What new thing did we discover? (A bug, a new request, a fresh idea).
3.  **The New Plan:** Why do we need to make this change now?

### 3.2. The Problem and Its Limits (The Agreement)

1.  **The Problem:** A crystal-clear statement of what’s broken.
2.  **What We're NOT Doing:** A list of things that are outside the scope of this project. This helps keep the project focused.
3.  **Comparison:** A simple “Before and After” table to show exactly what will change.

### 3.3. The To-Do List (The Smallest Steps)

**The most important part.** This is where you break the big solution down into tiny, separate tasks.

_How to write each task:_

- **Title:** A short summary.
- **Type:** {Fixing a bug / Building a new thing / Tidying up / Reorganizing}
- **Where:** {Which part of the project it affects}
- **Reason:** Why this specific little change is necessary.
- **The Plan/Sketch:** A simple drawing or description of the change (like a doodle or a recipe). **No complex code here.**

### 3.4. A Visual Guide (Optional)

_Good idea to include:_ A **simple diagram** that shows how things connect or flow. Use this if words alone are too confusing.

### 3.5. How It Will Be Used (Optional)

_Good idea to include:_ Real-world examples of how people will use the new feature. This proves the design is easy and makes sense.

### 3.6. Safety and Risks (Optional)

1.  **Risks:** What could possibly go wrong?
2.  **Solutions:** How will we prevent those bad things from happening?
3.  **Golden Rules:** What must absolutely not change? (e.g., “The app must not get any slower.”)

### 3.7. How We Know We're Done

A checklist of things to verify (like tests and documentation) that tells us the project is officially “Done.”

### 3.8. Other Ideas We Considered

A list of other options we thought about but decided against, and a short explanation of _why_.

> [!NOTE] It's Okay to Be Incomplete
> If you're just starting and don't have all the answers, it's fine to mark sections with `(To be decided)` or `(Coming soon)`. The structure is a guide to help you figure out what you need to know, even if you don't know it yet.

## 4. The Life of a Proposal

1.  **Idea:** An author writes down a rough draft, maybe by just talking it out.
2.  **Share:** The draft is shared with the team for feedback.
3.  **Discuss:** The team talks about the idea.
4.  **Improve:** The plan is updated based on the team's feedback and an :term[Alignment meeting]{href="./22_document_alignment.md" canonical="22: Company/Alignment"}.
5.  **History:** Once the project is done, the proposal is saved as a historical record. The final instructions in the Specification document take its place.

## 5. Key Facts

- **Time:** Usually written in about a day.
- **Updates:** Written only once to introduce the new idea.
- **Purpose:** Saved as part of the project's history.
- **It's the Main Guide for:** The **reason why** we started.
- **Think of it as:** Asking for feedback, or writing one chapter of a story.
