# 21: The Company/Making a Proposal

> [!DEFINITION] Proposal Document
> A Proposal is a plan you write down when you want to change, improve, or add something new. You make this plan before you start building anything.

## 1. The Core Idea

A Proposal Document is basically like asking your friends for their opinions on an idea before you start working on it (this is often called a "Request for Comments" or RFC).

You write **one** for each new project to let everyone know you want to make a change. You need a plan because you can't solve a big problem all at once; you have to break it down into smaller steps. One Proposal is like **one big step** in a project.

This plan is **saved forever**. It becomes the official story of why we decided to change things and what we wanted to achieve.

## 2. Why We Need It

Why write a plan instead of just starting to code right away?

- **Getting Past the 'Blank Page' Problem:** A computer can't read your mind. Writing a proposal helps you pull ideas out of your head and put them into words. The best way to start is just to **talk about your idea out loud** and have it written down. This helps when you feel stuck.
- **A To-Do List for Coders:** This plan is where all the small coding tasks come from. It makes sure every task is a small, clear job that someone can finish in about a day.
- **Separating 'What' from 'How':** It lets us talk about *what* we want to build separately from *how* we're going to build it. This way, we can agree on the big idea first without arguing about the tiny details of the code.
- **A Safe Place to Try New Ideas:** You can suggest big, new ideas without messing anything up. If people don't like the idea, no problem! All you have is a text file that you can just throw away.
- **Instructions for the AI Helper:** Our AI helpers (and our human teammates) need clear instructions. This plan gives them the exact information they need to understand what to do.

## 3. The Structure (A Template)

A proposal follows a strict story format to make sure the idea makes sense and is safe to build. These are the usual parts of the story, but you can change them if it helps explain your idea better.

### 3.1. The backstory (How We Got Here)

_The story goes like this:_ "We used to think X, but we learned Y, so now we need to do Z."

1.  **What We First Believed:** What was our old way of thinking?
2.  **The Turning Point:** What new thing did we discover? (Did we find a bug? Get a new idea?)
3.  **The New Plan:** Why do we have to make a change now?

### 3.2. The Problem and Its Boundaries (Our Agreement)

1.  **The Problem:** Explain exactly what's wrong, in a way that can be proven true or false.
2.  **What We're *Not* Doing:** Make a clear list of all the things this plan will *not* change. This is super important so nobody gets confused.
3.  **Before and After:** A simple chart showing how things were before and how they'll be after the change.

### 3.3. The Smallest Steps (The Plan of Attack)

**This is the most important part.** Here, you break your big solution down into tiny, separate pieces of work.

_How to describe each small step:_

- **Title:** A short name for the step.
- **Type:** Is it fixing a bug, adding something new, cleaning up old code, or reorganizing things?
- **Where:** Which part of the code does this step affect?
- **Why:** A quick reason for this specific change.
- **The Plan:** A simple sketch of the change, like a recipe or a simple drawing. No real code yet!

### 3.4. A Picture (Optional)

_Good idea:_ Include a simple diagram to show how things will work. Use this if words aren't enough to explain your idea.

### 3.5. How People Will Use It (Optional)

_Good idea:_ Show real examples of how someone will use the new feature. This proves that your design is easy and comfortable to use.

### 3.6. Safety and Risks (Optional)

1.  **Risks:** What could go wrong?
2.  **Safeguards:** How will we stop it from going wrong?
3.  **Golden Rules:** What must NOT change? (For example, "The app must not get any slower.").

### 3.7. How We Know We're Done

A checklist to prove the work is finished (like checking that all tests pass, the instructions are updated, and everything works together).

### 3.8. Other Ideas We Had

List the other ways you thought about solving the problem and explain why you didn't choose them.

> [!NOTE] It's Okay to Not Have All the Answers
> If you're just starting, it's fine to mark some sections with `(Not Sure Yet)` or `(Coming Soon)`. The structure is there to show you what you *need* to figure out eventually.

## 4. The Life of a Proposal

1.  **Write a Draft:** Someone writes the first version, maybe by talking it out or using an AI helper.
2.  **Share for Review:** The draft is shared with the team so they can look at it.
3.  **Discussion:** Everybody talks about the idea and gives feedback.
4.  **Agreement:** The team agrees on the final plan and writes it down in a special "Agreement" document.
5.  **Update:** The original proposal is updated to match what everyone agreed on.
6.  **Lock it in:** The proposal is marked "Accepted" and can't be changed anymore.
7.  **Build it:** The plan is used to update the main project blueprints.
8.  **Save it:** The proposal is saved forever as part of the project's history.

## 5. Quick Facts

- **How long it takes:** Usually written in about a day.
- **How often it's changed:** You only write it once to capture the new idea.
- **Its purpose:** It's saved forever as a record of the past.
- **What it's the boss of:** It's the official record of *why* we did something.
- **Think of it as:** Asking for comments, or one big step in our project.
