# 02: How We Get Things Done

> [!DEFINITION] Our Standard Process
> This is our team's recipe for turning big ideas into real things we can build. It's about working together, building on our ideas, and checking in with each other often.


> Sidenote:

We're at a point where just exploring ideas isn't enough. To really build something amazing, we need a clear plan that everyone follows.

For a small team with a huge vision, we can't afford to be messy. This plan isn't meant to slow us down; it's the engine that helps us understand each other, develop complicated ideas, and make sure they actually get built. We stick to this process because it’s the only way to make our big ideas work.

## 1. The Living Blueprint

> [!DEFINITION] The Blueprint Document
> The official and always-updated guide that explains our product's vision, how it's designed, and how to build it.

The most important thing we do is create and take care of our Living Blueprint. It’s not just boring paperwork; it's the master plan that contains all our ideas. This document gives our team and our AI helpers the map they need to work together. We update it all the time, so it's always a reliable guide that gets more detailed as we figure things out.

- **Sticking to the Truth:** We follow our own rules for being super clear and honest (from :term[00: Company/Truth]{href="./00_truth.md"}) to make sure every plan is complete and easy to understand. This is necessary to make our plans truly "living."
- **Right is Better Than Fast:** Unlike a quick note, the Living Blueprint has to be perfect. It's better to leave a part of the plan blank than to fill it in with wrong information. Everything else we build stands on this foundation.
- **Growing Through Review:** The blueprint is never "done," it's just "up-to-date." When we review it, we find spots we missed or things that don't connect. Fixing these makes the blueprint bigger, not because we want it to be complicated, but because we need it to be crystal clear before we start building.
- **The Destination:** This document is our map. It shows *where we are going*. It lets everyone see the big picture without having to memorize the entire plan. We all agree to follow this map.

## 2. The Change Proposal

> [!DEFINITION] The Change Proposal Document
> A quick, temporary document we use to agree on changes, fix misunderstandings, and explain what to do next before we update the main Blueprint.

Because our Living Blueprint is so important, we can't just change it whenever we want. We need a way to discuss and agree on changes. The Change Proposal is how we do that. It’s a fast, simple way to say, "I've thought about this problem, and here is my idea." It helps us fix misunderstandings and decide on the exact change we're going to make.

- **Sticking to the Truth:** Just like the Blueprint, a Change Proposal has to be very clear. We follow the rules in :term[00: Company/Truth]{href="./00_truth.md"}. We have to state exactly what is wrong and what we will do about it, so our AI helpers don't get confused.
- **Speed is Key:** These proposals need to be written quickly, usually on the same day the idea or problem comes up. They're not meant to be perfect, just clear enough to make a decision.
- **Fixing Misunderstandings:** A Change Proposal is how we correct our course. It says: "We used to think X, but we learned Y, so now we will do Z." It turns confusion into a clear plan.
- **A Mission Briefing for the Machine:** Our AI helpers need very clear instructions to work well. This document is like a mission briefing for them, explaining the specific changes, the reasons for them, and any rules they need to follow. It makes sure the AI is working on the right problem.
- **Exploring Options:** This is the place to suggest a few different ways to solve a problem. It lets the team pick the best path before anyone wastes time building the wrong thing.

## 3. The Agreement Cycle

> [!DEFINITION] Pull Request (PR)
> The official way we check our work, make sure we all understand it, and get agreement on everything we make—from documents and plans to computer code.

A Pull Request (or PR) is more than just a way to submit work; it's where we build a shared understanding. We use it for everything we create, from big ideas to tiny details. It's how we all agree on the *plan* before the work begins. It turns one person's idea into the whole team's decision.

- **More Than Just Code:** We use PRs for all our work. It's how we agree on plans, designs, and big decisions. This is where "my idea" becomes "our plan."
- **Discussions are Important Information:** We have all our discussions in the comments on GitHub. The person who wrote the plan **must** reply to every comment. This conversation is valuable because it explains *why* we made our decisions.
- **Explain Your Thinking:** Saying "Okay" isn't enough. To make sure everyone is on the same page, the person who created the plan needs to explain their thinking, like: "I now understand X," or "I thought this was about Y." This helps our AI understand the *reasoning* behind a change, not just the change itself.
- **Clarity Over Shortness:** The goal is for anyone (including our AI) to be able to read the conversation and understand *what* was decided and *why*. Hidden knowledge is useless knowledge.
- **Summarize to Finish:** Once everyone agrees, we use the Change Proposal process to turn all the comments into one clear plan. This makes sure all the good ideas from the review are saved forever.
- **No Surprises:** By agreeing on the plan first, we know exactly what work is coming next. No surprises.
- **Shared Responsibility:** When you approve a PR, you are taking on shared responsibility for it. The author isn't working alone anymore; they're carrying out a plan the whole team believes in.

Here's an example of a command we give our AI helper to create a Change Proposal based on PR comments:

```
Instruction: https://idealic.academy/en/company/51_prompt_evolution_draft.md/
PR: https://github.com/idealic-ai/platform/pull/65

Analyze PR comments using instructions since 3 days ago
```

## 4. The Daily Check-in

> [!DEFINITION] 1-on-1 Calls
> Quick, daily chats to help us get unstuck, answer questions, and maintain trust with each other.

We check in with each other every day to make sure nobody gets lost or stuck while working alone. These calls aren't for boring status updates; they are active problem-solving meetings.

- **Daily 10-Minute Check-ins:** A short, focused chat with a team leader to make sure our compass is still pointing in the right direction.
- **Come Prepared:** You must bring topics to discuss. This makes sure we use our time to solve real problems and make decisions.
- **A Process We Can Trust:** This daily habit removes the anxiety of not knowing if you're on the right track. Leaders confirm the direction is right, and team members confirm they have what they need. This builds the trust we need to work on our own without being micromanaged.

## 5. The Role of the Machine

> [!DEFINITION] AI Assistance
> Using AI to boost our ideas, improve our plans, and carry out the small details for us.

We use AI not to think for us, but to help us stick to our plans. The AI is a powerful tool, and our Change Proposal is the instruction manual that tells it what to do.

- **Talk to Plan:** We often just talk out our messy thoughts, then use an AI to neatly organize them into a clear Change Proposal.
- **Instructions for the AI:** The Change Proposal is the main set of instructions we give our AI. If the proposal is clear, the AI can create code, tests, and other documents with amazing accuracy.
- **Check the AI's Work:** We review the AI's output to make sure it matches our plan. If the AI gets it wrong, it’s a sign that our instructions weren't clear enough, not that the machine failed.

## 6. How We Grow as People

> [!DEFINITION] Professional Growth
> Learning the skills needed for the future by practicing this clear, document-focused way of working together.

Working this way isn't just extra paperwork; it’s training for the future. This process teaches us to think like AI architects and innovators, showing us how to guide intelligence—both human and artificial.

- **Working with AI:** By learning to structure our thoughts for machines, we are learning the language of the future. We are moving from being people who "use" AI to people who "direct" AI.
- **Skills for the Future:** The ability to turn a big idea into a crystal-clear plan is the most valuable skill in the age of AI. This work gives us experience that will shape our entire careers.
- **Becoming Better Thinkers:** This process forces us to be clear, precise, and thoughtful about who will be reading our work (a person or an AI). It helps us become better thinkers and better teammates.

## Summary

We trade the feeling of total freedom for the power to make real progress. By having rules for *how* we decide, we give ourselves the freedom to achieve anything. We write to get on the same page, we get on the same page to build trust, and we build trust to get things done.
