We’re at a point where we need to stop just exploring and start building amazing things. To do that, we need a clear set of rules to follow.

Our team is small, but our dream is huge, so we can't use old, slow methods. These rules aren't meant to hold us back; they are the tool that helps us share ideas, understand complex plans, and make sure everything gets built correctly. We're all agreeing to follow this process because it's the only way we'll succeed.

## 1. The Living Specification

> [!DEFINITION] Specification document
> The official master plan for what we are building. It’s a single, always-updated instruction book that explains the vision, the design, and all the details.

Our most important job is creating and taking care of this master plan. It's not just a boring document; it’s the instruction manual for our goals. It gives everyone—both people and our AI assistants—the big picture they need to work together. We update it all the time, so it's always a helpful guide that gets clearer and more detailed as we learn more about what we're building.

- **Following the Truth:** We stick to the rules in :term[00: Company/Truth]{href="./00_truth.md"} to make sure our plan is super clear, makes sense on its own, and doesn't have any confusing parts. This is key to making sure our plan is always useful.
- **Right is Better than Fast:** This isn't a rough draft. The master plan has to be correct. It’s better to leave a part of the plan blank than to fill it in with the wrong information. Everything else we build depends on this plan being right.
- **Growing by Reviewing:** The plan is never 'done,' it's just 'up-to-date.' When we read it over, we find parts we missed or questions we haven't answered. Filling in these gaps makes the plan bigger and better, not because we like making things complicated, but because we need it to be crystal clear before we can build.
- **The Destination:** This document is like our map. It shows everyone where we're headed. No one has to keep the entire journey in their head, because we can all look at the map and know we're going the same way.

## 2. The Evolution Document

> [!DEFINITION] Evolution document
> A quick, temporary note we use to agree on a change before we update the master plan. It helps fix misunderstandings and gives clear instructions for what to do next.

Because our master plan is so important, we can't just change it on a whim. We need a way to discuss and agree on changes first. That's what the Evolution Document is for. Think of it as a quick proposal or a sketch. We use it to explain a problem and make sure everyone understands it the same way. It's the bridge between a new idea in our heads and an action for our AI assistant to perform.

- **Following the Truth:** Just like the master plan, these quick proposals must follow the rules in :term[00: Company/Truth]{href="./00_truth.md"}. We have to be very clear and direct, saying exactly what’s wrong and what we're going to do about it. This way, our AI assistants don't get confused.
- **Speed is Key:** These proposals need to be written fast, usually the same day we spot a problem. They aren't fancy reports; they're built for quick understanding and making a decision right away.
- **Fixing Misunderstandings:** An Evolution Document is like a course correction. It clearly says: "We used to think X, but now we know Y, so we’re going to do Z." It helps us learn from our blind spots and turn them into a clear new plan.
- **Instructions for the AI:** AI needs perfectly clear instructions to work well. This document is the 'prompt' we give our AI. It explains the exact changes to make, why we're making them, and any rules to follow. This makes sure the AI is working on the right problem.
- **Exploring Options:** This is the perfect place to suggest different ways to solve a problem. It lets the team pick the best path before anyone wastes time building the wrong thing.

## 3. The Cycle of Consensus

> [!DEFINITION] Pull Request
> The official way we check, improve, and agree on everything we make—from documents and plans to computer code.

A Pull Request (PR) isn't just for programmers. For us, it’s the main way we build agreement. We use it for everything: big ideas, quick proposals, and the code itself. Think of a PR as putting an idea up for a team vote. Before any work starts, we make sure everyone signs off on the _plan_. This turns one person's idea into the whole team's commitment.

- **More Than Code:** The PR process is for all our work. We use it to agree on what words mean, how the system should be built, and what our goals are. It’s how 'my idea' becomes 'our plan.'
- **Comments are for Improving, Not Chatting:** When someone leaves feedback on a plan, it isn't a text message conversation. It's valuable information that the author needs to use to make the plan better.
- **Combine, Don't Argue:** The person who wrote the plan must take all the feedback and use it to make a better version. This shows they understood everyone's points and ends endless arguments.
- **No More Surprises:** By agreeing on the plan first, we all know what's going to happen next. There are no surprises in our daily work because we already approved the plan together.
- **Shared Ownership:** When you approve a plan, you're saying 'I'm on board.' You become partially responsible for how it turns out. The person doing the work isn't alone anymore; the whole team is behind them.

## 4. The Ritual of Synchronization

> [!DEFINITION] 1-on-1 Calls
> Quick, daily check-ins between people to solve problems, answer questions, and keep our teamwork strong.

We check in with each other every day to make sure we don't drift apart while working on our own tasks. These calls aren't for listing what you did yesterday—we can read that later. They are for actively solving problems and making sure we're all still headed in the same direction.

- **Daily 10-Minute Check-ins:** A super short, focused call with the team leader to make sure your compass is still pointing in the right direction.
- **Come Prepared:** You have to bring your questions or problems to the meeting. This makes sure we use the time to solve real issues or make important decisions.
- **The Comfort of Knowing:** This daily habit removes the stress of wondering if you're doing the right thing. The leader confirms the plan is good, and you confirm you have everything you need. This builds trust so everyone can work freely without being bossed around.

## 5. The Role of the Machine

> [!DEFINITION] AI Augmentation
> Using AI to boost our ideas, organize our plans, and carry out the detailed work.

We don't use AI to think _for_ us. We use it to put our thoughts into action. Our clear plans (the Evolution Documents) are the instructions, and the AI is the powerful tool that follows them.

- **Speak Your Mind:** We often start by just talking out our ideas. Then, we use AI to help organize those messy thoughts into a clear, structured plan.
- **A Clear Plan for the AI:** The Evolution Document is the main instruction we give the AI. If the document is clear, the AI can write code, create tests, and even update the master plan for us, and it will do it correctly.
- **Check the Work:** We check the AI's work against the rules in our documents. If the AI makes a mistake, it's usually because our instructions weren't clear enough. It’s our fault, not the machine's.

## 6. The Human Growth

> [!DEFINITION] Professional Evolution
> Learning the most important skills for the future by practicing how to work together using these clear documents.

Following these rules and writing these documents isn't just boring paperwork. It's training for how people will work in the future. This system teaches us to think like the architects and inventors who guide AI, showing us how to give great directions to any kind of intelligence, whether it's human or machine.

- **Working with AI:** By learning to make our thoughts clear enough for a machine to understand, we are learning the language of the future. We stop being people who just _use_ AI and become people who _direct_ AI.
- **Skills for Life:** Being able to explain a big idea in a clear, detailed plan is the most valuable skill you can have in the world of AI. The work we do here gives us amazing experience that will help us throughout our careers.
- **Becoming Better Thinkers:** This whole process makes us think more clearly and carefully. It teaches us to see things from the reader's point of view (whether that reader is a person or an AI). We become sharper thinkers and better teammates.

## Summary

We give up a little bit of 'do whatever you want' freedom to gain the power to make real progress. By having clear rules for how we make decisions, we open up amazing possibilities for what we can build. We write things down to get on the same page. We get on the same page to trust each other. And we trust each other so we can build great things together.
