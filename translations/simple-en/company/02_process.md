# 02: How We Work Together

> Our Rulebook
> This is our game plan for turning big ideas into real things we can build and use. It's all about working together, learning as we go, and checking in with each other often to make sure we're on the same page.

## 1. The Evolution Document

We don't just wing it. We follow a plan. And if the plan is missing or isn't working, we don't just guess what to do next. Instead, we make something called an **Evolution Document**.

- **Speed is Key:** These documents are like quick memos, not giant books. We write them fast, usually the same day we realize we need one. The goal is to be clear and quick, not perfect.
- **A Map for Course-Correction:** An Evolution Document isn't a roadmap of the future. It's more like a note you write when you realize you're going the wrong way. It says, "We thought this approach would work, but we learned something new. So, here's our new plan."
- **Instructions for the AI:** These documents also act as super clear instructions for our AI helpers. An AI is like a powerful assistant that takes everything you say literally. These documents give it the most up-to-date information so it works on the *current* plan, not an old one.
- **The New Official Plan:** Once everyone agrees on an Evolution Document, it becomes the new plan. No one is allowed to do something different unless we write a *new* Evolution Document to change the plan again.

## 2. The Cycle of Agreement (Pull Requests)

A "Pull Request" is how we show our finished work and ask the team, "Do we all agree this is the right change?" It's more than just checking for mistakes in the code.

- **Feedback is for Building, Not Chatting:** When people leave comments on your work, it’s not a text message conversation. You shouldn't just reply to each comment one-by-one, because long back-and-forth arguments can get confusing.
- **Combine Ideas, Don't Argue:** Instead of arguing in the comments, the person who did the work gathers all the feedback and uses it to write a new Evolution Document. This shows everyone, "I heard you, I understood your ideas, and here's how I've updated the plan to include them."
- **Agree on the Plan Before Building:** By agreeing on the Evolution Document *before* anyone starts building, we all know what to expect. This avoids surprises and means we don't need managers looking over everyone's shoulder.
- **Shared Responsibility:** Giving your approval isn't just a casual click. It means you're taking on responsibility. When you say 'yes' to a plan, you're saying, "I'm on board with this, and I'll share in the success or failure."

## 3. The Living Blueprint

While Evolution Documents are for fast, small changes, the **Main Document** is our big, permanent blueprint for the whole project. We take our time with this one.

- **Be Right, Not Fast:** It doesn't matter if the Main Document takes a long time to write. What matters is that it's correct. It can start small and grow as we learn more.
- **Finding Blind Spots:** Reading through the Main Document helps us spot things we missed. Adding these missing pieces isn't about making the project bigger for no reason; it's about making our plan clearer. We can't know what to do next until we fully understand what we're doing now.
- **Updating the Big Picture:** Over time, all the small changes from the Evolution Documents get folded back into the Main Document. This keeps the blueprint up-to-date and helps new people understand the project's history.

## 4. The Daily Check-in

We talk to each other very often for a few minutes so that we don't slowly drift apart and start working on different things without realizing it.

- **Daily 10-Minute Chats:** Every person on the team has a quick 10-minute chat with their leader every day.
- **Be Prepared:** You have to come to the meeting knowing what you need to talk about. This isn't for small talk; it's for getting help, making decisions, and getting back on track quickly.
- **A Process We Can Trust:** This daily habit makes sure no one feels lost or alone. It builds trust. The leader trusts the team is following the plan, and the team trusts they have support to keep moving forward.

## 5. The Role of the AI

We use Artificial Intelligence to make our own ideas more powerful, not to replace our thinking.

- **Talk First, Refine Later:** We often just speak our ideas out loud to a computer to get them written down. Then, we use AI to help organize those thoughts and make them sound more clear.
- **The AI's Instruction Manual:** The Evolution Document is the perfect set of instructions for an AI. It gives the AI all the information it needs to help us write code, create tests, or prepare other documents.
- **Check the AI's Work:** We don't just blindly trust what the AI creates. We always check its work against our plan in the Evolution Document. If the AI gets something wrong, it usually means our instructions weren't clear enough.

## Summary

It might seem like all these rules limit freedom, but they actually help us make real progress. By having clear rules for *how* we make decisions, we free ourselves up to achieve amazing things. We write things down to get on the same page. When we're on the same page, we trust each other. And when we trust each other, we can get incredible things done.
