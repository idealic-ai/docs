# AI Agency: Building Smart Systems Together

> **Heads-up**: This is an early draft, just getting the main ideas down.

## The Short Version

We build the foundation for the next wave of smart, independent AI workers. We partner with you for a **fixed price** to create complete, ready-to-use AI systems that become a core part of your business.

We don't charge you for our time; we charge for the result. We handle all the tricky tech stuff—the engineering, the setup, and making sure all the parts work together—so you can focus on your business goals.

## The Problem: Why AI Projects Often Don't Work Out

AI projects tend to fail for a few common reasons.

- **It's Hard to Connect Everything:** Getting an AI to do more than just chat is complicated. When you try to plug it into your real business systems, things get messy and break easily.
- **Thinking AI is a Magic Wand:** AI is a powerful tool, but it's just one piece of the puzzle. Without a solid plan for how to use it, it's more of a cool toy than a way to improve your business.
- **AIs Can Make Things Up:** The AI “brains” we use are creative, which means they can sometimes invent facts (people call this “hallucinating”). Without a manager to keep them in check, they can make mistakes that damage your reputation or business.
- **The Hidden Costs:** The cost of the AI itself is small. The real cost comes from fixing its mistakes, keeping it running smoothly, and managing its unpredictable behavior.
- **Finding the Right People is Hard:** Building reliable AI requires people with very specific skills that are rare and difficult to hire.

## Our Philosophy: Plan First, Build Second

Think of us as **architects for your business**. We don't just put a bandage on a problem. We study the deep structure of how you work to build a solution that grows with you.

**It’s much cheaper to fix a problem on the blueprint than after the house is built.** We create order with a clear four-step process:

1.  **The Blueprint (The Plan):** We start by creating a super-detailed document that explains exactly how your business works. This becomes the one and only source of truth for the project.
2.  **The Workflow (The Engine):** We turn that plan into an incredibly reliable system that is almost impossible to break. This system keeps track of every task, message, and detail, so it never gets confused, even if something goes wrong.
3.  **The Reactor (The Director):** This is like the director of a play or the referee of a game. It's a universal rule engine that manages everything. It decides whose turn it is and what happens next, making sure both humans and AIs follow the script.
4.  **The Agents (The Workers):** Finally, we add the AI “workers” to the system. They make smart decisions and handle complex tasks, but they always have to operate within the safe boundaries set by the workflow and the director.

This is **Building by Design**. We think, plan, and test everything out before we write a single line of code, so what we deliver works perfectly from day one.

## Our Solution: A System That Just Works

We give you a **“black box” solution that’s crystal clear on the inside.** You tell us what you need; we build the system that does it.

- **Ready to Go:** We take full responsibility for making sure the system delivers the result you want.
- **Test Before Building:** We use a special simulation system to test the entire plan and all its rules before we build the real thing. This helps us find and fix problems early.
- **The Plan is the Code:** Our blueprint is a living document. As your business changes, we update the blueprint, and the software updates with it. The software never drifts away from your business goals.
- **You're in Control:** You can look at how everything works, you own the critical parts, and you can even run it on your own computers if you wish.
- **Built to Grow:** We design our systems to handle millions of tasks from the very beginning, so they are reliable even when they get very busy.

## What Our Systems Can Do

### 1. The Reactor (The Game Engine)

The Reactor is like the central operating system or the stage manager for your business process. It defines the rules, keeps score, and directs the action.

- **Directing the Flow:** It decides “who does what next?” based on the current situation.
- **Change Rules Without Code:** The rules of the game (like who can do what, and when) are stored as simple data. This means you can change how your business runs on the fly, without needing a developer to rewrite the software.
- **Test and Reality are the Same:** We use the exact same engine for testing and for the live system. If a plan works in our tests, we know it will work for your real customers.
- **Perfect Memory:** Our AI agents have a memory that never fades. We use a special database (**TimescaleDB**) to summarize their entire history, allowing them to recall years of interactions. They aren't limited by the short-term memory of typical AIs.

### 2. The AI Agents & Their Planning System

We build AI agents that are safe, reliable, and easy to check up on.

- **Plan First, Act Second:** Before an agent does anything, it creates a visual map of all the steps it plans to take. This lets you see its entire strategy upfront.
- **You're the Boss:** A person can review the AI's plan, approve it, make changes, or tell it to stop.
- **It Learns the Best Way:** When an agent finds a good solution to a problem, it saves that strategy. It only needs to do deep thinking when it runs into something new.
- **Information on a Need-to-Know Basis:** We give each AI agent only the exact information it needs for its job, nothing more. It’s like putting them in a “clean room” with only the necessary files, which keeps data safe and secure.
- **Any AI Brain:** We can easily swap out the AI model (from OpenAI, Anthropic, or others) depending on what you need for cost, speed, or privacy.

### 3. Rock-Solid Foundation (Temporal.io)

We build our systems on **Temporal**, a powerful, open-source technology trusted by huge companies like Stripe and Netflix.

- **Super Resilient:** The workflows are tough. The system automatically handles errors, retries, and even computer crashes without losing track of what it was doing.
- **Handles a Huge Workload:** The system can easily manage millions of tasks running at the same time.
- **You Stay in Control:**
  - **Simple Billing:** You own the accounts with AI companies (like OpenAI) and pay them directly.
  - **Run It Anywhere:** You can run the system on your own computers for maximum security and privacy, which is great for rules like GDPR and HIPAA.
  - **Or Let the Cloud Handle It:** We can also set it up on Temporal's cloud service, so you don't have to worry about maintenance.
- **A Perfect Record:** Every single action in the system is recorded. This creates a perfect audit trail, making it easy to find and fix problems or just see what happened.

## How This Can Be Used

### High-Stakes Practice (The Sales Training Room)

Letting new salespeople practice on real customers is risky. We build lifelike simulators where they can practice and fail safely.

- **Example:** A new employee tries to sell a product to an AI character who has a specific personality and budget. The AI drives a hard bargain and gives feedback on how the employee handled objections.

### Smart Operations

Systems that can think and solve problems, not just pass along information.

- **Example:** An AI “Dispatcher” manages a team of drivers. It can negotiate with them to take extra jobs, solve scheduling conflicts, and adjust to real-world problems like traffic jams and bad weather.

### Next-Level Customer Support

AI agents that truly solve customer problems, not just send them to a help page.

- **Example:** An AI “Account Manager” can review a customer's account, find billing errors, issue a refund according to company policy, and even suggest new features based on how the customer uses the product.

### Expert Document Analysis

Turn piles of documents into useful intelligence.

- **Example:** An AI “Analyst” can read thousands of legal contracts and flag risks that a human might miss after reading for hours.

## The Deal: A Partnership

We work with you for a **fixed monthly fee**.

1.  **Flat Cost, Big Impact:** Your cost stays the same ($10k - $30k per month) even when the AI system is creating millions of dollars in value for you. We don't take a percentage of your revenue.
2.  **Your Own Lead Engineer:** You get a dedicated engineer who understands your business inside and out. They are backed by our entire research and development team.
3.  **You Buy the Fuel:** You pay the AI companies (like OpenAI) directly. This gives you total transparency into how much the system costs to run.
4.  **Long-Term Support:** We stick with you to manage and improve the system over its entire life.
    - _Option:_ If you ever decide you want to take it over, we have a plan for a smooth **hand-off** so your own team can run it.
5.  **Everyone Gets Better:** We keep ownership of our core “building blocks.” When we invent a better way to do something for one client, we upgrade it for all our clients. This means your system is always improving and never becomes outdated.
