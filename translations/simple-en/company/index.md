# How We Work Together

---

Think of these documents as our team's playbook. They explain our ground rules: how we communicate, how we get work done, and the shared ideas we all agree on. This is the official guide for _how_ we work as a team.

> Sidenote:
> Our company is the vehicle that carries our vision forward.

> - _What we're building:_ [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> - _How we build it:_ **Company Documentation**

This list connects our big dreams to our everyday tasks. It’s a manual for our collaboration, making sure every team member understands not just what we are building, but how we are building it.
