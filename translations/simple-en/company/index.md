# Company Documentation

---

These documents explain the very heart of how our company works. They set the rules for how we communicate, how we get work done, and the main ideas we all agree on. If you ever need to know _how_ we do things, this is the official guide.

> The company is the way we make our vision happen.

> - _Why?_ [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/)
> - _What?_ [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> - _How?_ **Company Documentation**

This list connects our big ideas to our everyday actions. Think of it as the instruction manual for working together, making sure everyone understands not just *what* we're building, but *how* we're building it.
