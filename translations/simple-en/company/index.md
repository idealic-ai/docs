# How Our Company Works

---

These documents explain the heart of how our company runs. They set the rules for how we talk with each other, the steps we follow to get work done, and the shared truths we all agree on. They are the official guide for _how_ we work together as a team.

> Sidenote:
> Our company is like a car, and our big idea is the destination we're driving to.
>
> - _Why are we on this trip?_ [Our Manifesto](../manifesto/)
> - _What's the main road we're taking?_ [Our Edict](../edict/)
> - _How do we drive the car?_ **These company documents**

This guide connects our big ideas to the small things we do every day. It's the user manual for how we team up, making sure everyone knows not just what we're building, but how we're building it together.
