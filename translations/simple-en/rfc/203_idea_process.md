# 203: Idea/Process

> **Process Idea:** Think of this as a recipe card that's also a photo diary of your cooking progress. It holds both the complete set of instructions for a project (the `Plan`) and a snapshot of exactly where you are in those instructions. The `schema` is the recipe itself, and the `solution` is the photo showing what you've done so far.

## 1. A Complete To-Do List in a Box

A **Process Idea** takes the concept of a self-contained package and applies it to big, multi-step projects. A `Vessel` is like a snapshot of a single decision, like choosing what to have for dinner. A `Process Idea` is a snapshot of the entire project of making that dinner, from chopping vegetables to serving the meal. It's a complete package that contains both the instructions and your current progress.

## 2. What's Inside a Process Idea?

A `Process Idea` uses three parts to keep track of a whole project:

- **`context` (The Goal):** This is the “why.” It’s the big-picture reason for the project, like “Bake a cake for Mom’s birthday.”
- **`schema` (The Blueprint):** This is the “how.” It’s the entire recipe or instruction manual—a map of every possible step you might need to take from start to finish.
- **`solution` (The Progress Report):** This is the “where we are now.” It’s a logbook of your progress. It keeps track of which steps are finished, what the results were (like the mixed batter), and what step is next.

## 3. The Superpowers of a Process Idea

By packaging the plan and the progress together, a `Process Idea` gives you some amazing abilities:

- **Saving and Resuming Your Game:** Imagine a really long project. You can hit “pause” at any time by saving its state as a `Process Idea`. It's like a save file in a video game. You can put it away for days or weeks, and when you load it back up, you can start again exactly where you left off.
- **Changing the Plan Mid-Stream:** An AI agent can look at a `Process Idea` at any point. Because it has the full blueprint (`schema`) and the current progress report (`solution`), it can adjust the rest of the plan if something new comes up. For example, if you run out of an ingredient while baking, it can figure out a new way to finish the cake without having to throw everything out and start over.
- **A Manager’s Bird's-Eye View:** A person can look at a `Process Idea` to understand the whole strategy and see how far along the project is. This makes it easy to check if everything is going right, find problems, or step in and give new instructions.

### 3.1. Interactive Time Travel

Just like a `Vessel`, a `Process Idea` is a permanent snapshot that lets you do a kind of time travel. By loading an old `Process Idea`, you can see the exact state of a project as it was in the past.

This is great for figuring out what went wrong or exploring “what-if” scenarios. You could load a project you paused a week ago, give it a different instruction, and see what would have happened. It turns every saved project state into a perfect simulation of the past, which is incredibly helpful for understanding and improving how AI agents work on complex tasks.
