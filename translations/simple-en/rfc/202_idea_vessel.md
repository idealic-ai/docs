# 202: Idea/Vessel

> **Vessel:** Think of a **Role Idea** as a blueprint for a job, like "Chef." A **Vessel** is the actual chef working in the kitchen, bringing that blueprint to life. The blueprint has a plan, or `schema`, that organizes a bunch of tools (like knives, pans, and ovens) and gets them working together at the same time. The goal is to produce `solutions` (the finished meals) that are surprisingly awesome and complex, something you wouldn't expect just by looking at the individual tools. This unexpected outcome is called "emergent behavior."

A **Vessel** is the active, working version of a **Role Idea**. The Role Idea is the job description, and the Vessel is the one doing the job.

This job description includes a `schema`, which is like a detailed instruction manual. It lists all the tools needed and explains how they should work together, often at the same time. To keep everything from becoming a mess, a planning system helps manage how and when each tool is used, especially since some steps depend on others (you can't frost a cake before it's baked!).

The `solutions` are the final results created by the Vessel as it follows the plan of its Role...
