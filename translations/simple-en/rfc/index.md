# Acts of Emergence

---

Think of these documents as the official blueprints for how we're building everything. They explain the exact rules and instructions our team agrees to follow. They're the go-to guide for all the technical details.

> Sidenote: [Idealic](http://idealic.ai) is a project all about setting ideas free.

> - To understand *Why* we're doing this, read the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/).
> - To understand *What* we're building, read the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/).
> - To understand *How* it all works, you're in the right place: the **Acts of Emergence**.

These documents connect our big dreams to the actual code that makes them real. They work together with the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (which explains *why* we're doing this) and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (which explains *what* we're building). By reading these 'Acts', you'll get the full technical picture of how everything works and fits together.
