# RFCs (Request for Comments)

---

Imagine we're building a giant, complicated LEGO castle together. Before we start snapping bricks, we need a plan, right? That's what these documents are. "Request for Comments" (RFC) is a fancy way of saying, "Here’s our blueprint. What do you think?"

These documents are the official plans our team has agreed on. They are the final rulebook for how every part of our system works and connects, so we can all build things the right way and make sure they fit together perfectly.

### Concept

> Sidenote: This part describes the most basic building blocks and the rules for how they talk to each other. It’s like defining the alphabet and grammar for our project's language.

### Ideas

> Sidenote: This section explains the simple, core pieces that make up what we call an 'idea' in our system. It's like explaining what atoms are before you build molecules.

### Ideator

> Sidenote: This is about all the background machinery that keeps everything running. Think of it like the power grid, roads, and factories that support a city.
