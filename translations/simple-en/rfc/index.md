# Acts of Emergence

---

These documents are like the official blueprints that explain how our team builds everything. They are the go-to guide for all the technical rules and plans we've agreed on. If you ever have a question about how a technical part of the system works, this is where you'll find the answer.

> Sidenote: Our company, [Idealic](http://idealic.ai), wants to set ideas free.

> *   _Why_ we're doing this: [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/)
> *   _What_ we're building: [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> *   _How_ we're building it: **Acts of Emergence** (that's this manual!)

This collection of blueprints connects our big vision to the actual code. It works together with the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (which explains *The Why*) and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (which explains *The What*). Reading these documents will give you a full picture of how all the pieces are built and fit together.
