# 010: Agent/State

> **State Message:** Imagine an agent (a smart computer program) is doing a task. A "State Message" is like its short-term memory. It's a little note that holds an object called `state`, which is where the agent jots down what it's currently doing or thinking. This note can also have a `schema`, which is like a set of rules for what kind of information can be written down. This memory is important because it sticks around between each step, or "tick," the agent takes, so it never forgets what it was doing.

This document explains the **State Protocol**. Think of it as the official rulebook for how an agent remembers things from one moment to the next.
