# Part I: The Vision

---

_The big idea here is to rebel against how the internet is becoming controlled by just a few giant companies. Our vision is to build a new kind of digital world based on decentralization, giving power back to individual people and communities._

### (Chapter 1) The Core Idea and Principles

Everything in our system is built on a few simple but powerful rules that help everything work together smoothly.

- **Everything is an Idea.** At its heart, every single part of the system—whether it's an app, a tool, a document, or a process—is just an "Idea." Think of it like a universal Lego brick. This makes the whole system elegant and unified.

- **Self-Contained and Self-Describing.** Every Idea is like a toy that comes with its own instruction manual built right in. It carries all the information needed to understand what it is and how to use it. This allows anyone, or even an AI, to understand and interact with it without any prior knowledge.

- **Every Idea Can Have Its Own Home.** Any Idea can be given its own unique web address, like its own house on the internet. If it's a common type of Idea (like an article), it gets a nice, custom-made page. If it's a special tool called an "Ideator," it gets a flexible, do-it-all interface.

  > Sidenote: [Act 102: Concept/Sovereignty](../rfc/102_concept_sovereignty.md)

- **Ideators are Ideas with an Input.** An "Ideator" is simply an Idea that's set up to receive instructions. This allows it to act like a machine or a program that you can tell what to do.

  > - [Act 005: Agent/Input](../rfc/005_agent_input.md)

- **Designed to Be Combined.** The system is built for putting things together. Because some Ideators (called Idea Transformers) can change other Ideas, you can chain them together to build amazing and complex workflows, just like snapping Lego bricks together.

- **AI as the Universal Translator.** We use Artificial Intelligence to understand and run these Ideas based on their self-describing instructions. This makes the whole system incredibly easy to use and adapt for new and creative purposes.

- **A Protocol for Living Ideas.** We're not just sharing static, boring data; we're exchanging living, breathing systems that can grow and change over time through teamwork and creativity.

### (Chapter 2) The Problem — The Golden Cage of Big Tech

The main problem today is the tempting but dangerous deal offered by big tech companies. At first, social media sites promised us a huge audience to lure us into their private ecosystems, where they collected our data and limited our choices. The latest version of this deal is powerful AI tools that are too useful for many to refuse. But this convenience comes at a price. By weaving these platforms deeper into our lives, we become dependent on them, trapping us in a golden cage that's built not around our freedom, but around controlling our digital lives.

### (Chapter 3) The Solution — A Decentralized Rebirth

The solution isn't to build a better "walled garden," but to leave those gardens entirely and settle a new, open frontier. It’s a return to the dream of the early, decentralized internet, but redesigned for the age of AI. This rebirth is built on two main pillars: a new way of building with ideas and a new philosophy for connecting with others.

- **A Vision of Autonomy:** We propose moving from *platforms* to a *protocol*—an open standard for sharing not just static content, but living, functional ideas. Users run **AI models locally** on their own computers and connect through **peer-to-peer networks**, giving them full control over their data and digital lives. The goal is to create an operating system for ideas, where powerful, interactive systems—like a self-updating budget or an auto-correcting project plan—can be shared as easily as a document, with no big company in the middle.

> Sidenote: In a decentralized network, all users and services are equal and connect directly to each other, with no one in the middle.

> graph TD
>         A((" ")) <--> B((" "))
>         A <--> C((" "))
>         A <--> D{{"Service"}}
>         B <--> C
>         B <--> E((" "))
>         C <--> F{{"Service"}}
>         D <--> E
>         D <--> F
>         E <--> F
> ```

- **A Philosophy of Connection:** This system also creates a deep shift in our online relationships. The act of sharing something is freed from the game of mindless, performative "oversharing" and returns to its roots: a **thoughtful, intentional gift** within a circle of trusted friends. It’s a move from a global firehose of content to meaningful, local exchanges where trust, quality, and real connection are what matter most. This lets people create their own "hidden worlds," giving them complete control over how and with whom their ideas are shared.
