# Part II: The Protocol

_The dream of a new, free internet can’t be built on the old, shaky one. Trying to mix the old with the new is like building a castle on sand. To create something truly free and strong, we need a completely different foundation, designed from scratch. This isn't just a new app or website—it's a new set of rules for a new kind of game._

### (Chapter 4) The Architecture of Freedom

**An Operating System for Ideas**

We aren’t building another giant website that wants to own all your time and data. We're creating something more like an _operating system for ideas_—it’s like the soil where a thousand different worlds can grow. The goal isn’t to make one huge app for everyone, but to give people fertile ground where they can plant living ideas, letting them grow, change, and connect with each other. Other people can—and should!—build their own apps to work with this system. Some tools might be simple libraries for storing ideas, while others could be complex machines for thinking them through. The power of this new network will come from its variety, not from one single plan made by someone in the middle.

These rules of the game can be expanded. **Ideas** (which are like living documents you can share and build on) come in different types. For example, there’s a “Record,” a “Process,” or an “Agent.” We are offering a basic set of these “Ideas” to get started. But anyone can invent and create their own type of “Idea.” Not every app has to understand every type of idea. A simple app might only work with “Records,” while a more advanced one could manage entire “Processes.” This lets the system grow and change, like a building set where everyone can design their own unique pieces.

An idea can be born in your own private “black box”—like on your computer, where your data is stored and your personal A.I.s work. When you share that idea, it carries a “birth certificate” showing where it came from, but it doesn’t give away the secrets of how it was made. This creates a perfect balance: we get a network of knowledge where you can trace every idea’s journey, but everyone’s personal space stays secure. You can work with the result without needing to know all the secrets behind it. And if there are gaps in an idea’s history, you can treat them like interesting puzzles to solve.

This kind of system frees creators from needing to control everything. Responsibility is shared among all the participants—the people and communities who decide for themselves how they want to connect. The goal isn’t to run a website, but to bring to life a set of rules that are, by their very nature, free.

### (Chapter 5) How the Living Network Works

This architecture of freedom is built on one simple principle: **everything we share *is* the rules.** There are no hidden commands or secret servers. The entire system is made of just one thing: the **Idea**. Every Idea is a self-contained packet that holds three things: the **content** (the thought itself), the **schema** (an instruction manual explaining what the thought is and how it can be changed), and the **context** (the story of how it came to be). These packets are the messages, the commands, and the results. There’s nothing else. This setup gives you complete control over your ideas. You’ll never be trapped, because you can take all your packets and leave at any time.

- **Nothing Can Be Erased:** In this system, there is only one action: sharing an Idea. Once created, Ideas are forever; they can't be changed or deleted. To build on a thought, you create a new Idea that links back to the old one. This keeps a clean, unbroken chain of creation, like writing in a notebook only with a pen. This gets rid of a ton of the complexity that normal systems have.

- **A Network of Links:** Every Idea keeps its “family history” in the form of **links**, creating something like a family tree for thoughts. And this isn't just a dusty record in an archive; it's a living, growing network. When a “parent” Idea is updated (meaning, a new version of it appears), all the “child” Ideas that link to it get a notification. Their owners can then decide if they want to accept the changes. It’s like working together on an open-source project and allows the whole network of ideas to evolve together.

- **A Universal Translator:** The three-part structure of the packet makes the system incredibly easy for anyone to use. Since every Idea carries its own instruction manual (schema) and history (context), any program can easily work with it. Your first step into this new world is a simple five-line program: it takes a packet with an idea, shows it to an A.I. (like an LLM), and gets a new packet back with a response. This tiny piece of code can instantly understand and process any Idea in the network, even one that hasn’t been invented yet. You don’t have to be a master coder to join in; the A.I. acts like a magic translator that levels the playing field for everyone.

> Sidenote: An Artificial Intelligence (LLM) is the universal way to work with ideas. It's like a magic black box that can understand any `Idea` without special programming and turn it into a new, meaningful `Idea`.

- **A Universe of Permissionless Creativity:** This lets the system expand without anyone’s permission. Anyone can invent a new type of Idea and start sharing it, and the rules of the game instantly update for everyone. You don’t have to convince anyone to add support for your new invention. Because every Idea is a self-contained packet, even the simplest program with the “universal translator” can immediately understand and start working with a brand-new type of message. One person can invent a new concept, and the entire network can adapt to it in an instant.

### (Chapter 6) The Method — A Building Set for Creating Meaning

This method is like a Lego set or the way small, useful programs work in the Unix operating system. It’s based on a simple thought: **an Idea is not just information, but a “smart container” for it.** This container holds not just the thought itself (**content**), but everything needed to work with it (**schema** and **context**). This makes every Idea a tiny universe of meaning, ready to go.

> Sidenote: [Act 103: Concept/Ideator](../rfc/103_concept_ideator.md)
>

The agents that work with these Ideas are called **Ideators**. Picture them as robots that transform these “smart containers.” An **Ideator** takes one container with an Idea, does something to its content based on its instructions, and always gives back a new container with a new Idea. This simple agreement—“take a container, return a container”—makes the whole system very reliable.

> Sidenote: An Ideator can run on your personal device. It takes an Idea as input and produces a new one as output, while all its internal secrets and logic stay completely private and are never shown to anyone.

The strength of this system is its flexibility. An **Ideator** doesn’t need to understand all the complicated instructions of an Idea it receives. It just needs to check that the Idea has the parts it’s looking for. For example, an “Idea Improver” Ideator might say: _“I need any Idea that has a field named `title` in its content.”_ This gives it a huge amount of freedom.

The “smart container” model turns the whole system into a building set. Since every **Ideator** speaks the universal language of Idea-containers, you can line them up in chains, like on an assembly line. The system will figure out how to pass the containers from one robot to the next, letting you create very complex processes from simple steps. But that’s not the only way. You can also talk to any **Ideator** directly, just like a normal internet service.

Imagine an assembly line of **Ideators**: an initial `Idea` is sent to a **Simulator**, which imagines what could come of it. Then it goes to a **Critic**, which evaluates it. After that, it goes to an **Improver**, which refines the `Idea` based on the critique. And finally, it goes to a **Publisher**, which shares the result with the right people. Each **Ideator** is a simple, independent tool, but together they create a powerful system for thinking and creating.

This is how **digital life** is born: an `Idea` survives and evolves by convincing other programs and **Ideators** to spend their time on it. It travels through the network, getting processed, mixed, and improved at every step, and proves its value by continuing its journey.

> Sidenote: The system is like a building set, letting you assemble complex processes from simple, reusable Ideators. This diagram shows how an idea can evolve: it's split into several branches, processed by different chains of `Improver` and `Evaluator` robots, and then the best result is chosen by an `Arbiter` to start a new cycle of improvement.
