# 008: Agent/Imports

> **Import:** Think of it like a bookmark in a giant library book. It points to the specific information from the main environment that an AI needs to get a job done. An import helps the AI focus on what's important or gives it a clean, fresh workspace. This is all handled by the `_imports` setting. â€” [Glossary](./000_glossary.md)

In the document [004: Agent/Call](./004_agent_call.md), we talked about the different ways to run a task. You can do it **right here (Inline)** or in a **separate room (Module)**. You can also give it **exact instructions (Explicit)** or **let the AI figure it out on its own (Latent)**. The Imports Protocol explains how you can mix these styles and control what information the AI gets for each one.

## Combining Scope and Method

Imagine the AI is your personal assistant. Here are four ways you can give it a task:

1.  **Right here, with exact instructions (`_activity`)**: This is like handing your assistant a calculator and saying, "Add 2 and 3." It immediately does the simple action (`_activity`) with the information you gave it (`params`). You usually don't need imports here because everything is already simple and clear.

2.  **Right here, but let the AI figure it out (no `_activity`)**: You tell your assistant, "Here's a piece of paper with a problem on it. Solve it and write down the answer." The AI thinks for a moment and immediately writes down the final result (`_output`). By using `_imports`, you can make sure it *only* looks at that one piece of paper, so it doesn't get distracted by other things on the desk.

3.  **In a separate module, with exact instructions (`_module` + `_activity`)**: You send your assistant to another room (`_module`) with a specific instruction (`_activity`). If you use `_imports`, you are only giving them the exact documents they need for that one instruction. This way, they're working in a clean, quiet space without any clutter.

4.  **In a separate module, and let the AI figure it out (`_module`, no `_activity`)**: You send your expert assistant to another room with a general goal (`_module`). You pass them the information they need to get started using `_imports`. They use that information and what they already know to complete the task by themselves in their own "clean room."

## Narrowing the Field of View

The `_imports` setting is your main tool for controlling what information the AI can see. It's like an "approved list" for data that filters out everything else. It creates a focused, limited view for the AI, as if it's looking through a spyglass.

- **When a task runs right here (Inline)**: `_imports` help the AI concentrate on what's important.
- **When a task runs in a separate module (Module)**: `_imports` define *all* the information that will be available in its isolated workspace.

## Giving vs. Asking for Information: Static and Dynamic Imports

The way you write the `_imports` rule in a Tool's instructions determines whether it gets information automatically or has to ask for it.

- **Static Imports (Information is Given)**: If a tool's rules strictly say what it's allowed to see (for example, `_imports: { "const": ["input"] }`), then the information is **given** to it automatically. The creator of the tool decided ahead of time exactly which "documents" it gets to see. It can't ask for anything else.

        input("input")
        state("state")
    end

    subgraph Tool Call
        direction LR
        filter{{"_imports: ['input']"}}
    end

    input --> filter
    state -.-> filter

    subgraph Provisioned Context
        direction LR
        input_prov("input")
    end

    filter --> HITL{{Human approval}}
    HITL --> input_prov
    input_prov --> Execute(Execute Tool)

    classDef unused stroke-dasharray: 5, 5, stroke:#aaa, color:#aaa
    class state unused
    classDef optional stroke-dasharray: 5, 5
    class HITL optional
```

- **Dynamic Imports (Information is Requested)**: If the rules just provide a list of what the tool *can* ask for (for example, `_imports: { "type": "array", "items": { "enum": ["state"] } }`), then the information is **requested**. The AI decides what it needs from the approved list to do its job and then sends a request for it.

This method is especially useful when a person can approve or deny the request. It adds an extra layer of control and safety.

## The Power of a Limited View

- **Safety and Focus**: By limiting what the AI can see, imports protect private data from being seen by accident and help the AI concentrate better. This makes its work more predictable, accurate, and cheaper.
- **Neat and Tidy**: Imports let you build independent, reusable tools (modules). Each module works in its own "clean room" and doesn't interfere with others.
