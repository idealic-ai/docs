# Part I: The Vision

---

_The main idea is a rebellion against how the modern internet works. Think of the internet today like one giant shopping mall owned by just a few huge companies. They make all the rules. Our goal is to build a new digital world based on independence, where you're in charge of your own digital life._

### (Chapter 1) The Core Idea and Principles

The whole system is built on a few simple but powerful rules. They help everything work together smoothly.

- **Everything is an Idea.** At the very heart of this system, everything you see—an app, a tool, a document, a process—is just an “Idea.” Think of it like Lego bricks. Because everything is made from the same kind of block, it all fits together perfectly and keeps the whole system simple.

- **They Explain Themselves.** Every Idea comes with its own instruction manual built right in. Just like a new toy that has instructions in the box, any computer program or AI can look at an Idea and instantly understand what it is and how to use it, no setup required.

  > Sidenote: [Act 001: Agent/Request](../rfc/001_agent_request.md)

- **Every Idea Can Have a Home.** Any Idea can be given its own unique web address, like a house on the internet. When you go to that address, you see a webpage for that Idea. If it's an article, it looks like an article. And if it's an “Ideator” (a special kind of Idea), it comes with a simple, universal control panel so you can interact with it.

  > Sidenote: [Act 102: Concept/Sovereignty](../rfc/102_concept_sovereignty.md)

- **Ideators are Ideas That Take Action.** An “Ideator” is a special type of Idea that can take instructions from you. Think of a vending machine: you give it some money and press a button (that’s the “input”), and it does something in return (gives you a drink).

  > - [Act 005: Agent/Input](../rfc/005_agent_input.md)

- **Built to Connect.** The whole system is designed like a big box of building blocks that snap together. Some special Ideators, called “transformers,” can change other Ideas. You can link them up in a chain, so the output of one becomes the input for the next, letting you build really powerful tools.

- **AI is the Universal Helper.** We use a smart AI (like a helpful robot) as the universal “doer” for everything. Since every Idea has its own instruction manual, the AI can read it and figure out what to do, even for brand new tasks that no one has thought of yet. This makes the system super flexible.

- **The Living Ideas Protocol.** Instead of just sharing simple things like text files or photos, this system lets us share “living” ideas. Think of it like sharing a whole potted plant instead of just a seed. These “Ideas” are active systems that can grow and change over time, especially when people work on them together.

### (Chapter 2) The Problem: The Golden Cage of Big Tech

The big problem today is the tempting but dangerous deal we're offered by giant tech companies. First, social media gave everyone a stage to be famous, but in exchange, they took our data and limited our choices. Now, they're giving us powerful AI that's hard to say no to. But this convenience has a price. We get locked deeper into their systems and depend on them for everything. We end up in a “golden cage.” It's comfortable and shiny, but it's still a cage that takes away our freedom and control over our own digital lives.

> Sidenote: A typical centralized network, where one platform owns all the data and controls every user.

### (Chapter 3) The Solution: A Decentralized Rebirth

Our solution isn't to build a better cage. It's to leave the cages behind and explore open land. We want to bring back the spirit of the early, free internet, but with all the power of modern AI. This plan has two main parts: a new way to build things online, and a new way to communicate.

- **A Vision of Independence:** Instead of using big platforms like Facebook or Google, we want everyone to use a shared, open language (a “protocol”) that anyone can use. On this language, you can share not just text and pictures, but living, working Ideas. Everyone will run **AI on their own computer** and connect **directly to others (peer-to-peer)**, with no company in the middle. That way, all your data and your digital life stay under your control. The goal is to create an operating system for ideas, where smart programs (like a budget that manages itself, or a project plan that updates itself) can be shared as easily as we share documents today.

> Sidenote: In a decentralized network, everyone is equal—both regular users and services. They connect directly to each other, with no central server in command.

>         A <--> C((" "))
>         A <--> D{{"Service"}}
>         B <--> C
>         B <--> E((" "))
>         C <--> F{{"Service"}}
>         D <--> E
>         D <--> F
>         E <--> F
> ```

- **A Philosophy of Communication:** This system also changes how we talk to each other online. Right now, social media feels like drinking from a fire hose—a never-ending flood of content from everywhere. We want to make sharing meaningful again, like giving a **thoughtful, deliberate gift** to people you trust. Instead of being overwhelmed, you can have real exchanges in small, trusted groups where quality and connection matter most. This lets everyone build their own “cozy worlds” and control exactly who they share with and what they share.
