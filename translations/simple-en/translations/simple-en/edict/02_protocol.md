# Part Two: The Rules of the Game

---

_The way we build things on the internet today is a little broken. A few big companies control everything. We can't just fix it; we need to start over with a new set of plans. We're not building another website or app that traps you. Instead, we're creating a set of rules, like a recipe book, that anyone can use to build their own amazing things. This is a "protocol," not a "platform."

### (Chapter 4) A Blueprint for Freedom

**An Operating System for Ideas**

We are not building another giant website that wants to own all your data. Think of what we're making as more like Windows or macOS. But instead of managing computer files, it manages *ideas*.

The goal isn't to build one big app for everyone. The goal is to create rich soil where new ideas can be planted, grow, and connect. Other people are encouraged to build their own tools on this soil. Some might build a simple app to store ideas, while others might build powerful tools to see how thousands of ideas connect. The whole system gets more powerful because of all the different things people build, not because of one master plan.

This system is designed to grow. **Ideas** are like living documents you can share and build on. They come in different types, like a `Record` (which is just a piece of information), a `Process` (which is a set of steps), or an `Agent` (which is like a little robot worker). We give you a few basic types of `Idea` to start, but anyone can invent new ones. A simple app might only need to understand `Records`, while a fancy app could work with complex `Processes`. This lets people build special tools without making things too complicated for everyone else.

> Sidenote: A little worker program on your private computer can work on an Idea you send it. It takes your input box and creates an output box, but its own secret instructions and private data are never shared with you.

An idea can start on your own private computer—your "secret lab"—which holds your personal data and AI helpers. When you share an idea, it contains clues about where it came from (like a family tree), but it never reveals the secret recipe you used to create it. This gives us the best of both worlds: you can see an idea's history as it travels across the internet, but everyone's private creative space stays private. You can use someone’s creation without needing to know *exactly* how they made it.

This design frees creators from feeling like they have to control everything. The responsibility is shared by everyone who uses the system. The goal isn't to be the police of a website, but to give people the rules to a game that is free by its very nature.

### (Chapter 5) How a Living Web Works

This whole system is based on one simple but powerful rule: **the idea itself contains all of its own instructions.** There are no secret computer commands. The only thing that moves through this system is the **Idea**. Each Idea is like a little digital package with three parts:

1.  **The Solution:** This is the main content, like a piece of writing or a picture.
2.  **The Schema:** These are the rules for what the content means and how it can be changed.
3.  **The Context:** This is its history, like a family tree showing where it came from.

These little packages are everything. They are the messages, the starting points, and the final results. Because everything you need is inside this one package, you truly own your ideas. You are never locked into one company's service. You can pick up all your ideas and move them somewhere else whenever you want. All the cool features below happen because of this simple design.

> Sidenote: [RFC 101: Concept/Idea](../rfc/101_concept_idea.md)
>

*   **Written in Permanent Ink:** The only thing you can do in this system is share a new Idea. Ideas are permanent, like words written in ink. You can't ever change or delete them. To update a thought, you create a *new* Idea that points back to the old one, saying, "This is the new version of that." This keeps a perfect, unbreakable history of how thoughts grow over time and makes the whole system much simpler.

*   **A Family Tree of Ideas:** Every Idea automatically remembers where it came from. This creates a giant, connected family tree of ideas. And it's a living tree! When a "parent" Idea is updated with a newer version, all the "child" Ideas that were born from it are notified. This lets the owners of the child ideas decide if they want to use the new changes. It's how everyone can build on each other's work and grow together.

*   **The Universal Translator:** This simple three-part package makes it easy for any computer program to understand any Idea. The "Hello, World!" program for our system—the simplest thing you can possibly build—is just five lines of code. It’s a tiny web server that takes an Idea package, shows it to a smart AI, and then shares the AI's response as a new Idea. Because the AI is so smart, this little program can instantly understand and talk to *every* Idea on the network, even types of Ideas that haven't been invented yet! The AI acts as a universal translator, making sure everyone can participate fairly.

    > Sidenote: [RFC 104: Concept/Latent](../rfc/104_concept_latent_.md)
    >
    > The AI is the default tool for working with Ideas. It's like a magical black box that can understand any `Idea` you give it, without needing special code written for that type of Idea. You give it one Idea, and it gives you a new, useful Idea back.

    > graph TB
    >     Input[/Input Idea/] --> LLM@{ shape: cloud, label: "Latent Space" }
    >     LLM --> Output[\Output Idea\]
    > ```

*   **Build Anything Without Asking:** This system lets anyone invent new things without needing anyone's permission. You can create a new type of Idea and start sharing it, and the whole network can work with it instantly. You don't have to beg a big company to update their software. Because every Idea package explains itself, even the simplest program with its "Universal Translator" can understand a brand-new type of message. One person can invent a new tool, and everyone can use it right away.

### (Chapter 6) The Method — Building with LEGOs of Meaning

The way this works is inspired by simple tools that do one thing really well, like LEGO bricks. The big secret is this: **an Idea is not just information, it's a smart box.** It holds the main content (**the solution**) along with its own instruction manual and history (**the schema and context**). This makes every Idea a self-contained package of meaning, ready to be used by anything or anyone.

> Sidenote: [RFC 103: Concept/Ideator](../rfc/103_concept_ideator.md)
>

The little robot worker programs that operate on Ideas are called **Ideators**. Think of them as little machines on an assembly line. An **Ideator** takes one Idea-in-a-box as its input, does something to what's inside, and always produces a new Idea-in-a-box as its output. This simple rule—box in, box out—is what makes the whole system so powerful and predictable.

> Sidenote: Because the system is like LEGOs, you can build complex processes out of simple, reusable worker programs (Ideators). This picture shows how you might improve an idea. You make copies of the idea and send them to different assembly lines of `Improvers` and `Evaluators` that all work at the same time. Then, a judge (`Arbiter`) picks the best result, and that becomes the new version of the idea for the next round.

>     Evaluator1 --> Arbiter{{Arbiter}}
>     Evaluator2 --> Arbiter

A really cool part of this is how **Ideators** check their work. An **Ideator** doesn't need to understand every single detail of an Idea it gets. It just looks for the specific parts it needs. For example, an "Idea Improver" machine might just say: *"I will work with any Idea as long as it has a 'title' that is a piece of text."* This makes it super flexible.

This "idea-in-a-box" model is what makes it feel like building with LEGOs. Because every **Ideator** machine speaks the same language (the language of the Idea-box), you can snap them together to create powerful assembly lines. A planner program can build these assembly lines automatically, connecting different machines without getting confused.

For example, imagine an assembly line of **Ideators**: a starting `Idea` box is sent to a **Simulator** machine to guess what might happen with it. The new box it creates is sent to a **Critic** machine that gives feedback. That box is sent to an **Improver** machine that makes it better. Finally, that box goes to a **Publisher** machine that shares it with the world. Each machine is a simple tool, but when you connect them, they create a powerful system for thinking and creating.

This is how an idea gets a kind of **digital life**: it survives and grows by being interesting enough for other programs and **Ideators** to spend energy on it. It travels across the network, being changed and improved at every stop. Its journey proves that it's a valuable idea.
