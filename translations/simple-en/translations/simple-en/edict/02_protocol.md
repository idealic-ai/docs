# Part II: The Rules of the Game

---

_Think about it this way: you can't build a strong, new skyscraper on top of the foundation of an old, shaky house. The internet today is built on old foundations that give a few big companies all the control. To build something new and free, we need to start with a completely different design. We aren't building just another website or app (a "platform"); we're creating a set of rules anyone can use to build their own things (a "protocol")._

### (Chapter 4) The Blueprint for a Free Web

**An Operating System for Ideas**

We're not making another giant social media app that wants to keep you scrolling forever. Instead, we're creating something more like an operating system (like Windows or iOS), but made just for ideas. It's the basic ground level that lets thousands of different worlds be built on top of it.

The goal isn't one huge app for everything. It's to create rich soil where ideas can be planted, grow, and connect. Other people can, and should, build their own apps and tools using these rules. Some might build a simple library to store ideas, while others could build powerful tools to understand them. The whole system gets stronger and more interesting because of all these different creations, not because one company planned it all.

The system is designed to grow. **Ideas** (which are like living documents you can share and build on) come in different types, like a `Record` (just information), a `Process` (a set of steps), or an `Agent` (something that can do things on its own). We provide the basic types to get started, but anyone can invent new ones.

And you don't need to understand every single type. A simple app might only know how to read `Records`, while a fancy one could manage complex `Processes`. This lets people create special tools without breaking everything for everyone else. It's like having a toolkit with basic wrenches and screwdrivers, but also letting anyone invent brand-new tools for specific jobs.

>Sidenote:
>Imagine you have a secret recipe for a cake. You can bake the cake in your own private kitchen (a "black box") and share the finished cake with the world. You don't have to share the secret recipe itself. The cake you share (the "Idea") comes with a note that says, "Baked by me, using my secret family recipe." People can see where it came from and who made it, and they can enjoy the cake, but your secret stays safe. This creates a web of trust where people can share what they've made without giving away their privacy.

This design frees people from having to be in charge of everything. The responsibility is spread out to everyone who uses the system. The goal isn't to be the police for a website, but to give people a set of rules for a system that is free just by how it's built.

### (Chapter 5) How a Living Web Works

The whole system is built on one very simple but powerful rule: **the idea itself contains all the rules.** There are no secret computer commands or hidden servers. The only thing that exists is the **Idea**.

Each Idea is like a complete package that has three things inside:
1.  **The Content (the main thing):** This is the actual stuff, like a poem, a picture, or a plan.
2.  **The Instruction Manual (what it is):** This explains what the content is, what it means, and how you can use it.
3.  **The Shipping Label (where it came from):** This shows where the Idea came from and what other Ideas it's connected to.

Since every Idea is a complete, self-contained package, you're never locked into one app or service. You can take your ideas and move them anywhere, anytime. Everything else about how this system works grows from this simple design.

- **You Can't Change the Past:** You can only do one thing in this system: share a new Idea. You can't go back and edit or delete old ones. Instead, to change a thought, you create a *new* Idea that points back to the old one. Think of it like a notebook where you can only write on a new page; you can't erase what's already been written. This creates a perfect, unbreakable history of how thoughts grow, which makes the whole system much simpler and more trustworthy.

- **A Web of Connections:** Every Idea knows which other Ideas it came from. This creates a connected web where you can trace any thought back to its beginning. It's not just a history book; it's a living network. If a big idea that many others are based on gets an update (by a new version being created), all the ideas that connect to it get a little ping. This lets people choose to update their own ideas if they want to, allowing the entire web of ideas to grow together, like a giant group project.

- **The Universal Translator:** Because every Idea-package comes with its own instruction manual, any computer program can understand it. The easiest way to get started is with a super simple, five-line program that just takes an Idea, shows it to a smart AI (like ChatGPT), and shares whatever the AI says in response. This little program can instantly understand and work with every single Idea on the network, even types of Ideas that haven't been invented yet! The AI acts like a universal translator, making it easy for anyone to join in and create things.

  >     Input[/Input Idea/] --> LLM@{ shape: cloud, label: "Latent Space" }
  >     LLM --> Output[\Output Idea\]
  > ```

- **A Universe Where Anyone Can Invent:** This simple setup makes it possible to be incredibly creative. Anyone can invent a brand-new type of Idea and start sharing it. You don't need to ask for permission. Because everyone has access to the "Universal Translator" (the AI), even the simplest apps can immediately understand and use this brand-new invention. One person can introduce a new concept, and the whole world can start playing with it right away.

### (Chapter 6) The Method — A LEGO System for Ideas

How we build with Ideas is inspired by simple, powerful ways of thinking, like the ones behind LEGO bricks or the Unix operating system, where you combine small, simple pieces to create amazing things.

The key insight is this: an **Idea is not just information, it's a mini-program**. It contains the main content (the **solution**) but also carries its own instructions for how to work with it (the **schema** and **context**). This makes every Idea a small, self-contained package of meaning, ready to be used.

>Sidenote:
>[RFC 101: Concept/Idea](../rfc/101_concept_idea.md)

The tools that work on these Ideas are called **Ideators**. Think of them as specialized robots on an assembly line. An **Ideator** always does the same thing: it takes one Idea-package as its input, does a specific job on it, and creates a new Idea-package as its output. This simple, reliable rule—package in, new package out—is what makes the whole system so powerful and predictable.

>Sidenote:
>[RFC 103: Concept/Ideator](../rfc/103_concept_ideator.md)

This is a link to an official proposal for a new idea. The name "RFC 103" is like a document number. RFC stands for "Request for Comments," which is a fancy way of saying, "Here's a detailed plan—what does everyone think?"

The plan itself is for something called an "Ideator." Think of it as the blueprint for a new digital tool or system that is built to work with ideas.

What's really cool is that an **Ideator**-robot doesn't need to understand everything about the package it gets. For example, an "Idea Improver" robot might just say: _"I'll work on any Idea, as long as it has a `title` I can read."_ It doesn't care about anything else in the package. This makes the tools incredibly flexible and easy to reuse.

This building-block model is what lets you connect everything together. Because every **Ideator**-robot speaks the same language of "Idea-packages," you can chain them together to create powerful workflows. You can build an assembly line of robots where the output of one becomes the input for the next. This lets you build very complex systems from very simple parts.

For example, imagine a workflow:
1.  An initial `Idea` is sent to a **Simulator** robot to imagine different futures.
2.  The results go to a **Critic** robot that points out the flaws.
3.  That feedback goes to an **Improver** robot that fixes the original `Idea`.
4.  Finally, it's sent to a **Publisher** robot that shares the final version with your friends.

Each robot is a simple, separate tool, but together they create a powerful system for thinking and creating.

This is what gives rise to a kind of **digital life**: an `Idea` survives and gets better by being interesting enough for other people and their **Ideator**-robots to spend time working on it. It travels through the network, getting remixed and improved at every stop. Its journey continues as long as it stays useful and important.
