# How to Write the Acts

This guide explains the rules for writing and editing 'Acts'. Following these rules helps make sure all the Acts look and feel the same, so they're easy for everyone to read and understand.

- **No Bold Links**: Don't make links **bold**. A link is already a different color and underlined, so people know they can click it. That's enough!
- **Special Words**: When you use a special word that's explained in our [Glossary](./000_glossary.md) (our dictionary), you need to wrap it in a special code: `:term[The Word]`. This code automatically turns the word into a special link that goes to its definition.
- **Links to Other Chapters**: To link to a whole other chapter, use a similar code with the address of that chapter, like `:term[Plan]{href="./012_agent_plan.md"}`.
- Donâ€™t change links that already point to a full chapter title like `010: Agent/Plan`. But if it's just a word like `Plan`, you should use the special code.
- **Definition Box**: Every Act must start with a special box that looks like this: `> [!DEFINITION]`. This box should contain the main definition of the Act's topic, taken from the glossary.
- **What's Next Box**: Every Act must end with a section that smoothly introduces the next Act, telling the reader what to expect.
- **Sidenotes for Links**: If you want to mention another Act or idea, put the link in a `> Sidenote:`. This keeps the main story flowing smoothly while still giving readers extra information if they want it.
- When you mark a word that's plural, like "Activities," you can still link it to the singular word "Activity" in the glossary. The system is smart enough to figure it out.
- Try not to say things like "This document explains..." or "In the next document...". Instead, make it flow like one continuous story.
- To add a new word and its definition to the glossary itself, use this format: `:dfn[The New Word]{canonical="..." href="..."}`.
