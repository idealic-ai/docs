# 004: Agent/Call

> [!DEFINITION] [Call](./000_glossary.md)
> A :term[Tool]{canonical="Tool"} is like a recipe for a task. A **:term[Call]{canonical="Call"}** is when you actually follow that recipe with specific ingredients. It's an instruction to _do something now_.

The :term[Tool]{canonical="Tool"} system sets up the list of things an AI agent knows how to do. The **:term[Call]{canonical="Call"}** system is all about how the agent actually does them.

A :term[Call]{canonical="Call"} is like taking a general :term[Tool]{canonical="Tool"} (like `searchTheWeb`) and turning it into a specific command (`searchTheWeb for 'pictures of kittens'`). While :term[Tools]{canonical="Tool"} describe _what can be done_, :term[Calls]{canonical="Call"} are the commands that say _how to do it right now_.

> [!HEADSUP] Heads up
> When you ask the agent to do something (a :term[Request]{href="./001_agent_request.md"}), and it decides to use several of its :term[Tools]{canonical="Tool"} to get the job done, that bundle of commands (:term[Calls]{canonical="Call"}) is called a :term[Vessel]{href="./202_idea_vessel.md"}. A :term[Vessel]{canonical="Vessel"} is like the agent's immediate plan of action.

## Call Results and Final Output

> [!DEFINITION] [Final Output](./000_glossary.md)
> The final answer the agent gives you once it has completely finished your entire request. It's the end result you were waiting for.

When you make a :term[Request]{canonical="Request"}, the goal is to get back a **:term[Final Output]{canonical="Final Output"}**. The AI brain (LLM) looks at all the information it has and makes a choice:

- If it has enough information, it creates the :term[Final Output]{canonical="Final Output"} right away, and the job is done.
- If it doesn't have enough information, it realizes it needs to learn more. So, instead of a final answer, it creates a set of :term[Calls]{canonical="Call"} to go find the missing pieces.

After these :term[Calls]{canonical="Call"} are finished, their results are added to the agent's memory. Then, the agent tries again with this new, better information, giving it another chance to produce the :term[Final Output]{canonical="Final Output"}. This cycle of asking questions and making :term[Calls]{canonical="Call"} keeps going until the main goal is reached.

This separation between tiny steps (getting results from :term[Calls]{canonical="Call"}) and the big final answer is what lets us build powerful agents that can solve complex, multi-step problems.

## Interactions with other systems

A :term[Call]{canonical="Call"} is just a simple instruction on its own. It becomes powerful when it works with other systems that control how it runs. These other systems are activated by special properties in a :term[Tool]{canonical="Tool"}'s blueprint (these properties start with `_`). This allows a single :term[Call]{canonical="Call"} to behave in many different ways.

Think of it like adding special modifiers to a video game character's ability. By understanding what these special properties mean, the AI can creatively combine them to build complex plans. It goes from just picking a :term[Tool]{canonical="Tool"} to inventing whole workflows on the fly. This teamwork between :term[Calls]{canonical="Call"} and these other systems is the secret to how the agent tackles big, tricky tasks.

> [!TIP]
> The next few points explain how :term[Calls]{canonical="Call"} connect to other parts of the system we'll discuss later. You don't need to understand them perfectly right now. You can always come back here later.

- **Doing something specific (`_activity`)**: The most basic upgrade is linking a :term[Call]{canonical="Call"} to a piece of computer code that always does the same thing. The `_activity` property tells the system, "Don't just think about this; run this specific code to get the answer."

  > Sidenote:
  > - [003: Agent/Activity](./003_agent_activity.md).

- **Asking for help (`_delegate`)**: A :term[Call]{canonical="Call"} can pass a job to another expert agent, called a :term[Delegate]{canonical="Delegate"}. It's like a manager giving a task to a specialist. The `_delegate` property usually points to a saved :term[Request]{canonical="Request"}, letting the agent reuse complex tasks easily. This keeps the work separate and organized.

- **Focusing its attention (`_scopes`)**: The :term[Scopes]{canonical="Scope"} system tells a :term[Call]{canonical="Call"} exactly what information it's allowed to look at. This is like giving someone only the documents they need for a specific task instead of the whole library. It helps the AI focus and produce better answers. When used with a :term[Delegate]{canonical="Delegate"}, it's even stricter, defining the *only* information the helper agent can see.

- **Saving the result (`_outputPath`)**: A :term[Call]{canonical="Call"} can be told where to save its result. It's like telling someone to put a finished document in a specific folder. The :term[Output Path]{canonical="Output Path"} property points to a spot in the agent's memory (:term[State]{canonical="State"}). This lets you chain tasks together, where the result of one :term[Call]{canonical="Call"} becomes the starting point for the next one.

  > - [008: Agent/Output](./008_agent_output.md).

- **Working on many things at once (`_instance`)**: A :term[Call]{canonical="Call"} can be told to work on one specific item in a big batch of items. The `_instance` property gives each item a unique ID, so the agent can run the same plan on many different things at the same time without getting confused. Itâ€™s like having an assembly line where each worker focuses only on the product right in front of them.

## From Actions to Data

While :term[Calls]{canonical="Call"} are about what an agent *does*, that's only half the story. The other half is the organized information, or data, that flows in and out of those actions. A :term[Call]{canonical="Call"} needs clean data to work with, and it needs to store its results in a clean way so the next :term[Call]{canonical="Call"} can use them.

The next document, :term[005: Agent/Data]{href="./005_agent_data.md"}, explains how we organize and manage all this information inside the agent.
