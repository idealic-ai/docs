A **Record Idea** is like a blueprint for holding information. This blueprint is called a `schema`.

The `schema` sets the rules for how its main content, called the `solution`, must be organized. Think of the `schema` as a fill-in-the-blanks form. The form tells you that you need to fill in a "Name" with text and an "Age" with a number. Sometimes, this form might even come with little "data tools" to help you work with the information.

The `solution` of a Record Idea is simply the **filled-out form**. Its main job isn't to figure something out, but to hold data in a neat, structured way that follows the rules, based on the specific situation (the `context`) it's in.
