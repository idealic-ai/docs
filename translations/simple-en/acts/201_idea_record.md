# 201: Idea/Record

> [!DEFINITION] [Record Idea](./000_glossary.md)
A Record Idea is like a template for holding specific information. For example, a recipe card is a template for a meal. The final, filled-out recipe is the structured information itself.

Think of a **Record Idea** as creating a fill-in-the-blanks form. It has a special set of rules, called a `schema`, that tells you exactly what kind of information goes where. For example, a `schema` for a contact card would say, "You need a spot for a name, a phone number, and an email address."

The `solution` is the actual filled-out form. So, if the `schema` is the blank contact card, the `solution` is your friend's information typed into those blanks.

Sometimes, these forms can also come with little built-in tools, like a button to automatically format the phone number correctly.
