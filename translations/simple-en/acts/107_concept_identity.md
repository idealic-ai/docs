# 107: Concept/Identity

> [!DEFINITION] Emergent Identity
> A clear pattern that shows up when you look at how a bunch of :term[Ideas]{canonical="Idea"} are connected to each other. Identity isn't a built-in feature of one single :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"}; it's something that appears from the way it relates to others.

In our system, **Identity** isn't a permanent name tag you stick on something. It’s a quality that shows up on its own. It's different from :term[Sovereignty]{canonical="Sovereignty" href="./102_concept_sovereignty.md"}, which is about who owns something and what its official name is. This kind of identity isn't given to just one object.

An :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea" href="./101_concept_idea.md"} all by itself doesn't really have an identity. It's just a little piece of information.

Identity is an **:term[Emergent Identity]{canonical="Emergent Identity"}**. Think of it like a character in a story. A character isn't just their name; they are defined by their relationships, their history, and their actions. Identity is the pattern you see when you look at the web of connections between many :term[Ideas]{canonical="Idea" href="./101_concept_idea.md"}. It's the story that gets told by how :term[Ideas]{canonical="Idea" href="./101_concept_idea.md"} grow, cause other :term[Ideas]{canonical="Idea" href="./101_concept_idea.md"} to happen, and get collected together.

## The Three Threads of Identity

The identity of anything in the system is woven together from three kinds of connections:

> [!DEFINITION] Lineage
> The family tree of an :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea" href="./101_concept_idea.md"}. It's the chain of saved versions that connects an :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea" href="./101_concept_idea.md"} to its past and future self. This thread gives you a complete, step-by-step history of how the :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea" href="./101_concept_idea.md"} changed over time.

> [!DEFINITION] Causality
> The 'cause-and-effect' link. This is when one :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea" href="./101_concept_idea.md"} directly makes another one get created. It's like a chain of dominoes, showing you not just *how* an :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea" href="./101_concept_idea.md"} changed, but *why* it changed.

> [!DEFINITION] Grouping
> A way to bundle a bunch of related :term[Ideas]{canonical="Idea" href="./101_concept_idea.md"} together into one package, like putting all your vacation photos into one album. This creates a group identity, where the collection means something more than all the individual pieces on their own.

## The "Joe" Constellation

With this in mind, we can think about a person like "Joe" in a new way. There isn't one single file or item that *is* "Joe." Instead, "Joe" is like a **constellation** of stars. We recognize the shape of the constellation—the pattern—that appears from all of his recorded thoughts and actions (:term[Vessel Ideas]{canonical="Vessel Idea" href="./202_idea_vessel.md"}) and how they're connected. We know it's "Joe" not by pointing to one spot, but by seeing the story that his web of connections tells.

## Time Travel Through the Web of Connections

This idea makes "time travel" even more powerful. When you look at an old :term[Vessel Idea]{canonical="Vessel Idea" href="./202_idea_vessel.md"}, you aren't just looking at a frozen snapshot. You're visiting a specific **point** on the giant, connected map of that person's identity.

From that point, you can explore the web of connections:

- Follow its **:term[lineage]{canonical="Lineage"}** forward and backward to see how that specific thought or action changed over time.
- Follow its **:term[causal chains]{canonical="Causality"}** to understand what caused it to happen and what other things it caused.

This lets you explore history with full context. You get a complete picture of someone's state of mind, their reasons for doing things, and the effect they had at any moment in time.

## From Simple Links to Parallel Worlds

These connections are a great way to understand how identities can form and grow. But when many people are working and experimenting together, things can get complicated. We need a better system to handle different versions and possibilities existing at the same time. The next documents explain a new model where these connections are managed in a system of "parallel realities."
