# Acts: How It All Comes Together

---

These documents are the official blueprints that explain exactly how our team agrees to build things. They are the master rulebook for all the technical parts of our system, making sure everything we create can work together perfectly.

> Sidenote:
> [Idealic](http://idealic.ai) is a project with one big goal: to set ideas free.
>
> - *Why are we doing this?* Read the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/)
> - *What are we building?* Read the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> - *How are we building it?* You're reading it now! These are the **Acts**.

Think of these documents as the bridge connecting our big dream to the actual, nuts-and-bolts work of building it. They work hand-in-hand with the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (which explains *Why* we're doing this) and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (which explains *What* we're building). By reading these Acts, you'll get a complete guide to how all the pieces of our system are built and how they communicate.
