# Acts of Emergence

---

These documents are the official rulebooks that explain what our team has agreed to build. They are the main guide for how the system's technology works, setting the standards we all promise to follow.

> Sidenote:
> [Idealic](http://idealic.ai) is a project about setting ideas free.

> - _Why?_ [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/)
> - _What?_ [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> - _How?_ **Acts of Emergence**

This collection of documents connects our big-picture dream to the nitty-gritty details of how we build it. It works together with the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (which explains *Why* we're doing this) and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (which explains *What* we are building). By reading these Acts of Emergence, you'll get a full technical picture of how the system is designed and put together.
