# Acts of Emergence

---

These documents are the official blueprints that explain our team's plan for building the system. They are the main guide for all the technical rules, setting the standards that we promise to follow and build on.

> - _What?_ [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> - _How?_ **Acts of Emergence**

This document is the bridge connecting the big vision with the hands-on building process. It's the 'How' that complements the 'Why' ([Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/)) and the 'What' ([Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)). Reading these Acts will give you a full technical understanding of how every part of the system is built and works together.
