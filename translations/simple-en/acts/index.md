# Acts of Emergence

---

These documents are the official blueprints that explain our team's plan for building the system. They are the rulebook for all the technical parts, setting the standards we promise to follow and improve upon.

> - _What we're building:_ [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> - _How we're building it:_ **Acts of Emergence**

This collection of documents connects our big vision with the actual code. It works together with the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (The Why) and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (The What). Reading these Acts will give you a full technical understanding of how the system works and how each part is built.
