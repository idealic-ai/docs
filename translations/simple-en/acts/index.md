# Acts of Emergence

---

These documents are the official blueprints for how our system works. Think of them as the master plan that our team has agreed to build. They explain the technical rules for everything, making sure all the parts we create fit together perfectly.

> Sidenote:
> [Idealic](http://idealic.ai) is a project that aims to set ideas free.
>
> - To learn *Why* we're doing this, read the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/).
> - To learn *What* we're building, read the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/).
> - To learn *How* it all works, you're in the right place: the **Acts of Emergence**.

This collection of documents connects our big dream with the actual nuts and bolts of building it. To get the full picture, it helps to read them along with the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (which explains *The Why*) and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (*The What*). By reading these Acts, you’ll understand exactly *how* the system works and how every piece is built.

### Agent

> Sidenote:
> This section is about the system's digital workers, called 'agents.' It explains what they can do and the step-by-step instructions they follow to get things done.

### Concept

> Sidenote:
> This defines the basic language and communication rules for our entire digital world. It's like setting the alphabet and grammar so all the different parts can understand each other.

### Ideas

> Sidenote:
> This explains what an 'Idea' is made of at its simplest level. Think of it like describing the basic particles—the protons and neutrons—that make up everything.

- [205: Idea/Budget](./205_idea_budget.md)

### Ideator

> Sidenote:
> This describes the essential background systems that keep everything running smoothly. It’s like the power plants and internet cables for a city—you don’t see them, but nothing works without them.

- [304: Ideator/Watcher](./304_ideator_watcher.md)

### Packages

> Sidenote:
> This is the collection of instruction manuals for our main programming toolkits. These toolkits give builders pre-made parts to help them create new things more quickly.
