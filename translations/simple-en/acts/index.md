# Acts of Emergence

---

These documents are the official blueprints for how we build our system. They're like the rulebook that explains all the technical details, setting the standards that we promise to follow as we create.

> Sidenote:
> [Idealic](http://idealic.ai) is a project with one big goal: to set ideas free.
>
> - To understand *Why* we're doing this, read the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/).
> - To learn *What* we're building, check out the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/).
> - To see *How* it all works, you're in the right place: the **Acts of Emergence**.

These "Acts" are the bridge connecting our big dream to the actual code. They work together with the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (which explains *Why* we're doing this) and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (which explains *What* we're building). By reading these documents, you'll get a full picture of how the system works and how every piece is put together.

### Concept

> Sidenote:
> This section lays out the basic rules for how information is organized and how all the different parts of the system talk to each other. Think of it as the grammar and vocabulary for our digital world.

### Ideator

> Sidenote:
