# Acts of Emergence

---

These documents are the official blueprints that explain exactly how we're building our system. They are the ultimate rulebook for all the technical details, a set of instructions that our team agrees to follow as we create.

> Sidenote:
> [Idealic](http://idealic.ai) is a project with a mission to set ideas free.
>
> - *The Dream (Why?)* [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/)
> - *The Rules (What?)* [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> - *The Blueprints (How?)* **Acts of Emergence**

This guide connects our big dream to the actual work of building it. It works together with the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (which explains *Why* we're doing this) and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (which explains *What* we're building). Reading these Acts will give you a complete picture of how all the pieces of our system are designed to work together.
