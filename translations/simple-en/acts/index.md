# Acts of Emergence

---

Think of these documents as the official blueprints for our system. They explain exactly what we've agreed to build and are the master guide for all the technical rules we follow.

> Sidenote:
> [Idealic](http://idealic.ai) is a project to set ideas free.
>
> - _Why?_ [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/)
> - _What?_ [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> - _How?_ **Acts of Emergence**

These documents are the bridge connecting our big-picture dreams to the actual, on-the-ground building process. They work together with our [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (which explains _Why_ we're doing this) and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (which explains _What_ we're building). By reading these Acts, you'll get a complete picture of how the system works, piece by piece.
