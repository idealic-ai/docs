# Acts of Emergence: The Blueprints

---

These documents are the official blueprints our team uses to build things. Think of them as the rulebook that explains exactly how all the technical parts of our system should work together. We've agreed to follow these plans as we build.

These documents are the bridge connecting our big dream to the actual nuts and bolts of how it's built. They work together with the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (which explains *Why* we're doing this) and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (which explains *What* we're building). By reading these Acts, you'll get a full picture of how every piece of the system works.
