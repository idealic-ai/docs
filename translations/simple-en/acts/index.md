# Acts of Emergence

---

These are the official blueprints our team uses to build the system. Think of them as the detailed instruction manuals that explain exactly how everything should work. They set the rules we all agree to follow.

> Sidenote:
> [Idealic](http://idealic.ai) is a project that aims to set ideas free.

> - *Why are we doing this?* [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/)
> - *What are we building?* [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> - *How are we building it?* **Acts of Emergence**

This collection of documents connects our big vision with the actual, hands-on work of building it. To get the full picture, you can also read the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (which explains *The Why*) and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (which explains *The What*). These Acts of Emergence will give you the complete technical story of how every piece is built.
