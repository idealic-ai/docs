# Acts of Emergence

---

These documents are the official blueprints that explain exactly how our system is built. They are the rulebook our team agrees to follow. Think of them as the master instructions that make sure all the different parts of our project fit together and work correctly.

> Sidenote:
> [Idealic](http://idealic.ai) is a project built to set ideas free.
>
> - _Why?_ The [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/)
> - _What?_ The [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> - _How?_ **The Acts of Emergence** (that's this!)

These blueprints connect our big vision with the actual work of building the system. They go hand-in-hand with the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (which explains *The Why*) and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (which explains *The What*). By reading these 'Acts,' you'll get a full technical picture of how everything works, piece by piece.
