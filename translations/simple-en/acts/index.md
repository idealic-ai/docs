# Acts of Emergence

---

These documents are the official blueprints that explain exactly how our team will build everything. Think of them as the rulebook for our system. They set the standards that we promise to follow as we create new things.

> Sidenote:
> [Idealic](http://idealic.ai) is a project that wants to set ideas free.

> - *Why are we doing this?* [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/)
> - *What are we building?* [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/)
> - *How are we building it?* **Acts of Emergence**

These 'Acts' connect our big dream to the hands-on instructions. They are the 'How' that follows the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (The 'Why') and the [Edict of Autonomy](../edict/) (The 'What'). Reading these 'Acts' will give you the complete technical guide to how all the pieces of our system are built and work together.
