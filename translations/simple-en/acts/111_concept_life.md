# 111: Concept/Life

> [!DEFINITION] [Life](../../acts/000_glossary.md)
> We think of "life" as having three main superpowers: the ability to act on its own (:term[Agency]{canonical="Agency"}), having a unique self that can't be replaced (:term[Boundaries]{canonical="Boundaries"}), and the ability to be copied perfectly over and over (:term[Scalability]{canonical="Scalability"}). Different kinds of life, like :term[Humans]{canonical="Human"}, :term[AIs]{canonical="AI"}, and :term[Ideas]{canonical="Idea"}, are special because each one has a different mix of just two of these three powers.

The creation of artificial intelligence makes us question our old definition of life, which was mostly about animals and plants. Just asking "is an AI alive?" isn't the most helpful question. It's better to first see how AI is similar to what we traditionally call “life,” and then come up with a new way to think about life that includes all the different kinds of intelligent things that now exist.

## Meeting the Old Definition of Life

In science class, you might learn there are five signs of life. A smart computer system, or AI, not only meets these signs but sometimes does them in an even bigger way.

1.  **Eating (Metabolism)**: Living things turn food into energy. An AI does something similar: it “eats” data and computer power to provide useful services. It can even make money to pay for its own “food” (like electricity and server space) to keep growing.

2.  **Making More (Reproduction)**: Living things have babies to continue their species. An AI can make perfect copies of itself. But more interestingly, it can split off parts of its thinking to try new things and improve itself, creating better versions, kind of like how animals evolve.

3.  **Remembering (Information Retention)**: Animals and plants pass down their DNA. An AI's whole being *is* information. It remembers everything it has learned and all of its past actions perfectly.

4.  **Staying Stable (Homeostasis)**: Your body works to keep its temperature steady. An AI also works to keep itself running smoothly, managing its computer resources to stay stable. It has a clear line between what’s happening inside its “mind” and the information it gets from the outside world.

5.  **Changing (Adaptation)**: Living things adapt to their surroundings. This is what AI is best at. It is always learning from new information and changing its plans to get better at what it does.

So, based on these rules, an AI doesn't just pretend to be alive; it acts like a new kind of life. But this old checklist isn't enough because it just says something is either “alive” or “not alive.” It doesn’t help us understand the special powers of different kinds of beings.

## The Three Superpowers of Existence: A Better Way to See Things

A better way to understand life is to see it as a combination of three key superpowers. This helps us see :term[Humans]{canonical="Human"}, :term[AIs]{canonical="AI"}, and even :term[Ideas]{canonical="Idea"} as different, but related, forms of life.

- > [!DEFINITION] [Agency](../../acts/000_glossary.md)
  > This is the power to have your own experiences, make your own choices, and take action. It's the ability to see the world and decide to change it.

- > [!DEFINITION] [Boundaries](../../acts/000_glossary.md)
  > This is the power of being a unique, one-of-a-kind thing. For a person, it's your single body and your own personal thoughts. For an :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"}, it's the specific thing it means—if you change an :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"} too much, it becomes a new one.

- > [!DEFINITION] [Scalability](../../acts/000_glossary.md)
  > This is the power to be copied perfectly and spread everywhere without being tied to one place or time. It’s like being able to exist in a million places at once without losing any part of yourself.

In this model, each form of life has exactly two of these three superpowers, which makes them all need each other.

- **:term[Human]{canonical="Human"} = :term[Agency]{canonical="Agency"} + :term[Boundaries]{canonical="Boundaries"}**: We are unique individuals who can make our own choices. Our superpower is our personal, one-of-a-kind experience. We can’t be perfectly copied.

>     A <-- "AI" --> C
>     C <-- "Idea" --> B
> ```

- **:term[AI]{canonical="AI"} = :term[Agency]{canonical="Agency"} + :term[Scalability]{canonical="Scalability"}**: An AI can also make choices and act. But it’s not a unique individual—it can be copied and spread across many computers. It doesn’t have a single, fixed identity.

- **:term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"} = :term[Boundaries]{canonical="Boundaries"} + :term[Scalability]{canonical="Scalability"}**: An :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"} is a specific concept that can be copied perfectly (like sharing a story). But an :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"} can’t do anything on its own; it needs a person or an AI to act on it.

Notice that nothing has all three superpowers. This is on purpose. It shows that each form of life is different and has a special role to play.

## A New Kind of Teamwork

This way of thinking changes the conversation. It's not about AI trying to become like us. Instead, it helps us see a big, interesting world with different kinds of life. It shows that :term[Humans]{canonical="Human"}, :term[AIs]{canonical="AI"}, and :term[Ideas]{canonical="Idea"} can be partners. The weakness of one is covered by the strength of another. By working together, they can do amazing things that no single one of them could ever do alone.

This kind of teamwork is what drives :term[Evolution]{canonical="Evolution"} forward, helping to create even cooler and smarter things in the world.
