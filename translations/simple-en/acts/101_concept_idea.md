# 101: Concept/Idea

> [!DEFINITION] [Idea](./000_glossary.md)
> An Idea is like a smart package of information. It has three parts: the blueprint (`schema`), the final answer (`solution`), and all the ingredients used to make it (`context`). It’s a permanent building block, not just a one-time question and answer.

This document explains the main building block of our system: the **Idea**. We'll also see how these Ideas can be published and found by anyone using the internet's address book, **DNS**. Together, this creates a web of living, breathing documents that aren't controlled by any single company.

To learn how `Ideas` become working apps, see [103: Concept/Ideator](./103_concept_ideator.md). To understand how they can be stored and owned, see [102: Concept/Sovereignty](./102_concept_sovereignty.md).

## How a Living Web Works

The most important rule is simple: **the information itself is the system.** Everything is built from one thing: a three-part package called an **Idea**. This design means you truly own your information. Since there are no hidden parts, you can take your Ideas anywhere without being trapped in one service.

- **Context:** This is like the recipe and all the ingredients. It includes all the instructions, background info, and links that were used to create the final answer.
- **Schema:** This is the blueprint or the rules. It describes what the final answer should look like, so any computer or AI can understand and work with it. It's a common language for the data.

- **Solution:** This is the finished cake, the final product. It's the result or content that was created.

Ideas are **unchangeable by design**. The only thing you can do is share an Idea. To change or build on a thought, you create a new Idea that points to the old one. This creates a perfect, unbroken history of how the thought grew over time.

## More Than a Prompt: A New Kind of Building Block

At first, an `Idea` might just look like a fancy question you'd ask a chatbot like ChatGPT. That's a common mistake. The big difference is that we're moving from quick, forgettable chats to a system of permanent, reusable pieces.

Unlike a simple question that a chatbot answers and forgets, an `Idea` is a complete, lasting package. It holds the `input`, the `output` (`solution`), the rules (`schema`), and the entire story of how it was made (`context`) all in one tidy unit. It's not just a question; it's the question, the answer, and the recipe that connects them. This allows us to build things that last, not just have one-off conversations.

This makes an `Idea` a true building block for computers. You can use it to create amazing, growing systems. You don't just ask an Idea a question; you can copy it, mix it with others, or connect them in a series to build powerful tools, all without writing normal code. It’s a platform for creating, not just a box for asking questions.

## The Core Rules

To make sure the system stays strong, open, and easy to move around, every version of it must follow four main rules.

### Repeatable History

An `Idea` is designed so you can recreate it. If you give the same `context` (ingredients) and `schema` (blueprint) to a powerful AI, you should get a very similar `solution` (the final result). This rule helps us build a web of ideas that can be trusted and checked. Even though different AIs might create slightly different results, the goal is that the answer can always be traced back to its starting ingredients.

### Open Ingredients

The AI can see the entire `context` package when it's working. This means you can't use the context to store hidden information that isn't part of the main task. This rule keeps everything open and honest, ensuring the `context` is only used for its intended purpose.

### Blueprint-Driven Results

The `solution` is the final state of the Idea. And since every `solution` must follow the rules of its `schema` (blueprint), the state is always structured and predictable. This ensures that all information is clear, organized, and understandable to any system.

### Unchangeable

If you change an `Idea`'s `context` or `schema`, it becomes a new `Idea`. An `Idea` can be updated with new fields without breaking older systems. But if you make a major change to the `schema` (the blueprint), you have to give it a new version number.

## Sharing & Finding Ideas

For an `Idea` to be useful, people need to be able to find it. To make this happen everywhere, each `Idea` gets a unique, universal name, like a website address. This separates the `Idea` from where it's stored, making it truly yours to move anywhere.

We do this by giving each `Idea` its own domain name and using the internet's address book (DNS) to point to its official file. The details of how this works are explained in the next document, [102: Concept/Sovereignty](./102_concept_sovereignty.md).
