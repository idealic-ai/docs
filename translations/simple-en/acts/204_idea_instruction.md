# 204: Idea/Instruction

> **Instruction Idea:** Imagine a super-detailed recipe that a computer can read. It's written in a special, organized format (called JSON Schema) so it can be saved and used over and over again. Its job is to give clear, step-by-step directions on *how* to change or improve something.

An **Instruction** is like a digital recipe that can be used again and again. It's written in a very structured way (using a format called JSON Schema) to guide a computer.

It provides a clear, step-by-step guide for an action called `refine`, which is just a fancy word for making a change or an improvement. The Instruction tells the computer exactly *how* that change should happen.

Think of it as a single Lego brick. You can use one brick to make a simple tweak, or you can snap many bricks together to build complex, multi-step projects, which we call `Processes`.
