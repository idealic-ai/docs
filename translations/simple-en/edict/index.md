# Edict of Autonomy

---

This document is the main blueprint for the new digital world we're building. It explains the “What” we are making. While our Manifesto explains *Why* we’re doing this, the Edict explains the vision, the rules, and the main parts of a system that is built to be fair and open, giving power to both individuals and groups.

> Sidenote:
> Our company, [Idealic](http://idealic.ai), wants to help ideas live and grow freely.

> - _Why we're building this:_ [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/)
> - **What we're building**: **Edict of Autonomy**
> - _How we're building it:_ [Acts of Emergence](../rfc/)

The Edict is organized into a few parts. “The Vision” describes our big goals. “The Protocol” explains the basic rules and TKTKTK. “The Impact” talks about how this new system could change things for people and society. It gives you the big picture of how everything fits together without getting lost in the tiny details of how each piece is built.

This document connects our big idea (the philosophy) with the step-by-step instructions for building it. It works together with the [Manifesto of Co-Liberation](../manifesto/) (The Why) and our detailed technical plans, the [Acts of Emergence](../rfc/) (The How). By reading this, you'll get a full picture of what we're building and why it matters.
