# Edict Of Autonomy

(Which is a fancy way of saying “A Declaration of Digital Independence”)

---

This document explains a big idea for a new kind of digital world. The internet we use today is mostly run by a few giant companies. This plan is about building something different, using an idea called **decentralization**.

Think of the internet like a huge kingdom where a few powerful rulers in big castles make all the rules. Decentralization is like instead building a world full of connected, independent towns. Each person and each community gets to be in charge of their own space and make their own rules.

The goal is to give power and control back to individuals and groups, so we can truly own our digital lives.
