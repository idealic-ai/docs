# Part I: The Vision

---

_The big idea here is to fight back against how the internet is being run today. Right now, a few giant companies control almost everything. This new vision is about building a digital world where regular people and their communities are in charge again, not big corporations._

### (Chapter 1) The Main Idea & Rules

This whole new world is built on a few simple but super strong rules. These rules make sure everything can work together smoothly.

- **Everything is an “Idea.”** Think of it like LEGO bricks. Everything in this system—whether it’s an app, a game, a notepad, or a set of instructions—is made from the same basic block, called an “Idea.” This keeps everything simple and makes it easy to fit pieces together.

  > Sidenote: [RFC 101: Concept/Idea](../rfc/101_concept_idea.md)

- **They Explain Themselves.** Every Idea is like a toy that comes with its own instruction manual built right in. You don’t need to look anywhere else to figure out what it is or how it works. This means any computer or AI can pick it up and instantly understand how to use it.

  > Sidenote: [RFC 001: Agent/Request](../rfc/001_agent_request.md)

- **Any Idea Can Have Its Own Home.** You can give any Idea its own website address, like a house having its own street address. This makes it easy to find and use. If it's something simple like a story, it will look like a webpage for reading. If it's a special tool (called an Ideator), it will open up like a mini-app you can use right away.

  > Sidenote: [RFC 102: Concept/Sovereignty](../rfc/102_concept_sovereignty.md)

- **“Ideators” are Ideas That Do Things.** An “Ideator” is a special kind of Idea that’s ready for you to give it something to do. Think of an Idea as a noun (a thing) and an Ideator as a verb (a thing that takes action). It’s like a recipe waiting for you to add ingredients, or a machine waiting for you to press a button.

  > - [RFC 005: Agent/Input](../rfc/005_agent_input.md)

- **Made for Teamwork.** This system is designed so you can connect Ideas together. Some Ideators can even change other Ideas. This means you can line them up like a chain of dominoes to create amazing and complex new things.

- **The AI is the Universal Translator.** We use Artificial Intelligence (the same kind that powers things like ChatGPT) to understand and run all these Ideas. Because every Idea explains itself, the AI can act like a universal translator that can read any instruction manual and make it work, even for brand-new things it has never seen before.

  > Sidenote: [RFC 104: Concept/Latent](../rfc/104_concept_latent_.md)

- **A Network of Living Ideas.** We're not just sharing boring, static files like photos or text documents. We're sharing things that are alive and can grow. It’s like sharing a plant seed that can grow into a tree, instead of just sharing a picture of a flower.

### (Chapter 2) The Problem — Big Tech’s Beautiful Trap

The main problem with the internet today is that big tech companies have offered us a deal that’s hard to refuse but is actually a trap. First, social media sites gave us a place to connect with anyone in the world. But in exchange, they started collecting our data and controlling what we see. Now, they are offering amazing AI tools that are so helpful it's hard to say no. But with every new tool we use, we get more and more stuck. They’ve built us a beautiful, shiny cage. It feels nice on the inside, but we slowly realize we’re trapped, and our digital lives don't really belong to us anymore.

### (Chapter 3) The Solution — A New Beginning for the Internet

The answer isn’t to build a slightly better cage. It's to leave the cages behind and start fresh in an open world. We need to go back to the spirit of the early internet, which was wild and free, but bring along all the cool AI technology we have today.

This new beginning has two main parts:

- **A Vision of Freedom:** Instead of everyone using a few monster websites (like Facebook or YouTube), we move to a shared set of rules—a protocol. Think of it like a secret handshake that lets everyone's computers talk to each other directly. You would use **AI that runs on your own computer**, and you would connect straight to your friends through **peer-to-peer networks**. This keeps your data and your digital world completely under your control. The goal is to create a system for ideas where you can share smart, active things—like a budget that manages itself, or a class project that automatically updates—as easily as you share a song, with no big company in the middle.

- **A New Way to Connect:** This new system changes how we connect with each other online. Right now, social media encourages us to share everything with everyone, all the time. This idea brings sharing back to what it should be: **a thoughtful choice to give something meaningful** to people you trust. Instead of drinking from a firehose of random content, you can have real conversations in smaller, trusted groups. It allows people to create their own “hidden worlds” online, giving them total control over who they share their ideas with.
