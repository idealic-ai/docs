The Incubator Budget demonstrates recursive funding where success breeds success.
Initial capital funds startups, which generate returns feeding back into the
Budget. Hard constraints ensure minimum viable funding (e.g., each startup
needs $50k minimum). The schema defines reinvestment formulas: successful
exits fund more startups, creating a self-sustaining economic engine.

The Agent Economy demonstrates emergent specialization through economic
incentives. Agents bid for tasks using earned credits, with the Budget's
schema rewarding efficiency and penalizing waste. Successful agents
accumulate resources to bid on harder tasks, naturally creating specialists.
Hard constraints ensure minimum agent diversity and prevent monopolization.

The Supply Network Budget showcases autonomous coordination through economic
signals. Suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors bid for resources using
multi-currency budgets (materials, transport capacity, storage space).
Smart contracts execute when budget constraints align. Hard minimums ensure
critical supplies, while the schema optimizes for global efficiency.

The Carbon Budget demonstrates planetary-scale coordination through economic
mechanisms. Organizations pledge carbon reductions as "negative currency"—
the goal is to accumulate the largest debt. The schema converts various
actions (reforestation, efficiency, innovation) into verified carbon credits.
Hard constraints ensure additionality and prevent greenwashing.

A Budget Vibe transforms static financial planning into a living economic engine.
It separates planning (schema defining rules), funding (explicit transactions),
and authority (delegated permissions). This enables modeling anything from simple
escrows to complex treasuries with automatic reinvestment logic, creating dynamic,
decentralized systems for managing any quantifiable resource.

The schema acts as a Budget's constitution, defining not just what to measure
but the nature of each goal—whether to maximize, minimize, or cap it. This
strategic context prevents blind optimization of single metrics and provides
wisdom about when goals are achieved and resources should pivot to other
priorities. It transforms budgets from constraints into active decision tools.

Budget solvability means the ability to generate a valid solution given
current resources. Hard constraints in the schema define minimum thresholds
below which no meaningful allocation is possible. Unsolvable budgets remain
as plans, making resource gaps explicit and actionable. This protects against
impossible commitments while providing clear funding targets.

Budgets evolve through three stages: planning (unfunded vision), partial
funding (limited operation above minimum thresholds), and full activation
(all constraints met). They aggregate diverse currencies asynchronously,
with the schema defining both aspirational goals and hard constraints.
This staged approach transforms fundraising into a transparent, measurable process.

Fractal planning enables Budgets to fluidly scale across time horizons.
Yearly strategic plans decompose into daily tactical targets, while daily
actions aggregate up to show strategic progress. Combined with the stats
engine's hierarchical aggregations, this creates seamless alignment between
long-term vision and immediate execution, with powerful simulation capabilities.

Budgets enable automated growth cycles where any metric becomes a spendable
currency. Success in one area (e.g., customer satisfaction) automatically
unlocks resources in another (e.g., quality initiatives). The schema defines
these relationships, creating transparent formulas where achievement directly
fuels future capacity, turning budgets into self-reinforcing growth engines.

The economic system operates through two foundational actions:
1. Funding creates a Budget Vibe via explicit transaction, moving value from
   source accounts into dedicated pools
2. Delegation grants spending authority without transactions, like issuing
   virtual cards that draw from the funded pool
This separation enables flexible, auditable value management where funding
and authority are independently controlled.

Market validation enforces three layers of protection: permission rules,
balance sufficiency, and ongoing solvability. A job posting is rejected if
committing its funds would violate any constraint or drop the Budget below
minimum thresholds. This creates a trustless marketplace where every accepted
job has guaranteed, verified funding that won't compromise the Budget's viability.

Spending uses a two-part transaction model: First, posting a task creates a
debit from the Budget (commitment). Second, task completion creates a credit
to the worker (settlement). This simple model ensures funds are properly
committed and books always balance, without complex escrow mechanisms.
Cancelled tasks simply credit back to the original Budget.

The transaction ledger is resource-agnostic, managing any quantifiable value.
Budgets can be funded with unrealized potential (physical assets, expertise)
and contain rules for conversion. Any resource can be tracked: money, compute,
storage, reputation. The refine primitive enables cross-resource transactions,
creating a unified system for all forms of value exchange and transformation.

The technical architecture separates the immutable ledger (source of truth)
from a real-time aggregation layer (performance). Events flow from ledger
to aggregator, maintaining live balances for fast validation. Every
transaction preserves complete lineage, enabling perfect auditability from
initial funding through final settlement. This provides both integrity and speed.
