The Incubator Budget demonstrates recursive funding where success breeds success.
Initial capital funds startups, which generate returns feeding back into the
Budget. Hard constraints ensure minimum viable funding (e.g., each startup
needs $50k minimum). The schema defines reinvestment formulas: successful
exits fund more startups, creating a self-sustaining economic engine.

The Agent Economy demonstrates emergent specialization through economic
incentives. Agents bid for tasks using earned credits, with the Budget's
schema rewarding efficiency and penalizing waste. Successful agents
accumulate resources to bid on harder tasks, naturally creating specialists.
Hard constraints ensure minimum agent diversity and prevent monopolization.


---

The Supply Network Budget showcases autonomous coordination through economic
signals. Suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors bid for resources using
multi-currency budgets (materials, transport capacity, storage space).
Smart contracts execute when budget constraints align. Hard minimums ensure
critical supplies, while the schema optimizes for global efficiency.

The Carbon Budget demonstrates planetary-scale coordination through economic
mechanisms. Organizations pledge carbon reductions as "negative currency"â€”
the goal is to accumulate the largest debt. The schema converts various
actions (reforestation, efficiency, innovation) into verified carbon credits.
Hard constraints ensure additionality and prevent greenwashing.
