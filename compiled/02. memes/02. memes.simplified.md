# Chapter 2: Memes — Tools as Shareable Concepts

## On the Term "Meme"

The term "meme" (/miːm/; MEEM) was originally coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book "The Selfish Gene." He described it as a unit of cultural information spread by imitation, akin to how genes propagate biologically. Wikipedia defines a meme as "an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme."

While the term "meme" is popularly associated with humorous internet images, its original, broader definition is remarkably fitting for the concepts discussed in this chapter. In our system, "Memes" are:

- **Ideas/Behaviors:** They represent defined tools or capabilities—specific actions or structured information.
- **Spread by Imitation (Adoption):** As we'll see, Vessels can discover, adopt, and share these Memes, leading to their propagation throughout the system.
- **Evolving:** Memes in our system have a lifecycle that includes refinement and evolution based on performance and feedback, much like cultural memes adapt over time.
- **Carrying Symbolic Meaning:** Each Meme, through its schema, symbolizes a particular function or task that can be performed.

Therefore, despite potential initial reactions based on the modern internet slang, the term "Meme" is deliberately chosen for its conceptual depth and accuracy in describing these shareable, evolving units of capability within our AI ecosystem.

> **Alice:** "So, using 'Meme' isn't just about being trendy with internet culture? It actually has a deeper, more academic meaning that fits?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! The original concept of a meme as a unit of cultural transmission—an idea that spreads, replicates, and evolves—is a perfect analogy for how these tool definitions function and propagate within our system."
> **Alice:** "So they're like little packets of 'how-to' that can be passed around, learned, and improved by different Vessels?"
> **Bob:** "You've got it. They are the system's way of encoding and sharing specific capabilities or behaviors, allowing them to spread and adapt, much like cultural memes."





For Large Language Models (LLMs) and the intelligent agents in our system (like Vessels) to perform specific tasks and interact in a structured way, they require clearly defined "tools" or "capabilities." These tools ensure that actions are predictable, inputs are understood, and outputs conform to expectations. The foundation for defining these tools in our system is JSON Schema.

## Understanding the Blueprint: What is JSON Schema?

The fundamental building block for defining such tools is **JSON Schema**.

Imagine an online form used for sending money, booking a flight, or signing up for a service. This form has specific fields: some for text (like a name), some for numbers (like an amount), some with pre-defined choices (like a country), and some fields might be mandatory while others are optional.

**JSON Schema serves as the master blueprint for such a form.**

It does not _show_ the form visually, but it describes all its operational rules:

1.  **What fields are expected?** (e.g., "recipientName", "amount", "currency", "departureCity")
2.  **What type of information goes into each field?** (e.g., "recipientName" must be text, "amount" must be a number, "currency" must be one of "USD", "EUR", "GBP")
3.  **Which fields are absolutely required?** (e.g., one _must_ specify an "amount" to send money)
4.  **Are there any specific formats?** (e.g., a date must be "YYYY-MM-DD", an email must look like "user@example.com")
5.  **Are there any limits?** (e.g., the "amount" must be greater than 0, a "password" must be at least 8 characters long)

Essentially, JSON Schema provides a structured method for defining the "shape" and rules for a piece of data. In our system, when an LLM (or any process) needs to perform an action or provide structured information, it uses a Meme (which _is_ a JSON Schema) as its guide. The LLM is effectively asked to "fill out a specific form" (the Meme/JSON Schema) correctly, providing all necessary information in the right format.

This ensures that when a "SendMoney" Meme is used, the system always receives the recipient's name, the amount, and the currency, because the JSON Schema for that Meme defines these as required pieces of information. This brings predictability and reliability to how functions are called and data is structured.

> **Alice:** "So, JSON Schema is like the strict teacher who makes sure everyone fills out their forms completely and correctly before they can be processed?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! It's the rulebook for the data. It doesn't care _what_ the data is for, only that it's shaped correctly. For us, it means when an LLM uses a Meme, we know the 'form' it fills will be valid."
> **Alice:** "So it's not the form itself I see, but the instructions for building that form?"
> **Bob:** "Precisely. It defines all the fields, what type of info they take, what's required, and any special rules, ensuring everyone agrees on the data's structure."

## Defining Our Tools: Memes as JSON Schemas

Building on this foundation of structured data definition, a **Meme** in our system is the term for a tool or capability available to Vessels and LLMs. Its definition _is_ a JSON Schema. This concept is directly equivalent to how the broader AI industry defines "tools" or "functions" for Large Language Models (often referred to as "LLM Tools" or "function calling"). Familiarity with how LLMs call external functions or use tools via JSON Schema descriptions provides a strong grasp of what a Meme represents at its core.

This Meme Schema acts as the contract for the tool, detailing:

- **What the tool does**: Implicitly through its name and description (often part of the schema's metadata).
- **What parameters it accepts**: The input fields defined in the JSON Schema.
- **The structure of its expected output**: How the result of the tool's operation will be shaped, also defined in the JSON Schema.

So, a Meme represents the "what" of an action—the specific function to be performed and the data it needs and produces. For example, a `CreateEvent` Meme (an LLM tool) would have a JSON Schema defining fields like `eventName`, `dateTime`, `location`, and `description`.

Drawing a parallel to the concepts in Chapter 1 (Vibes), the Meme Schema itself can be seen as the "equation" or the blueprint of a form. When an LLM decides to use this tool (Meme) based on the ongoing interaction (its `input`), the LLM's act of populating the Meme's fields with specific values is akin to finding a "solution" to that equation. The "filled form" – the completed JSON object conforming to the Meme Schema – becomes the concrete `solution` or _specification_ for that specific tool invocation. Just as a Vibe's `schema(input)` yields a `solution`, a Meme's `Schema(LLM_context_and_intent)` yields a specific, filled-out tool call specification. Crucially, this act of the LLM filling the schema is the _request_ for an action, not the execution of the action itself. The underlying system then takes this specification and performs the actual operation.

> **Alice:** "So a Meme _is_ just a JSON Schema, defining a tool, much like standard LLM function calling?"
> **Bob:** "Precisely. The schema is the tool's definition. The LLM, based on the conversation, decides 'I need to use the CreateEvent tool' and then fills out its schema with the details."
> **Alice:** "And that filled-out schema is like an order form for the system to actually do something?"
> **Bob:** "You got it. It's the specification for the action. The system takes that 'order' and executes it."





## The Lifecycle of a Meme

The journey of a Meme from a simple observation to an integral part of the system's behavior involves several stages. This lifecycle is not strictly linear but rather a set of interconnected processes that define how Memes are born, used, and refined. Understanding this lifecycle is key to grasping their power and flexibility as dynamic, evolving tools.

### 1. Origination: From Data Vibe to Meme

Memes are the executable blueprints for actions and content generation. Their lifecycle often begins with a **Data Vibe** – an immutable record comprising an `input`, a guiding `schema`, and its determined `solution` (as detailed in Chapter 1: Vibes).

- **Observation & Local Adoption:** A Vessel, recognizing the utility of a particular Data Vibe, can locally "promote" or adopt it. This act designates the Data Vibe as a **Meme** _for that Vessel_. This is a crucial act of local abstraction and repurposing:
  - The Data Vibe's original `schema` becomes the core of the Meme's functional definition (the JSON Schema tool).
  - Its recorded `input` and `solution` serve as a concrete, illustrative example of the Meme in action—how it's typically invoked and what a characteristic output looks like from that Vessel's perspective.
- **No Global Ceremony:** There is no separate, global "promotion" event. The Data Vibe itself, by being adopted by a Vessel as a tool, _becomes_ a Meme within that Vessel's context. Different Vessels can independently incorporate the same Data Vibe, each treating it as a Meme and potentially applying their own local parameterizations later on.
- **Multi-Example Learning (Optional):** A Vessel can create a more nuanced Meme by learning from multiple Data Vibes that share the **same underlying `schema`** but demonstrate different successful `input`/`solution` pairs. By observing various ways a "form" (defined by the schema) can be successfully "filled out" under different circumstances (inputs), the Vessel can generalize this understanding into a single, more robust Meme. This Meme becomes better at handling a wider variety of cases for that specific task or tool, effectively enriching its "experience" based on diverse examples of success for the same core function.

This transformation of a Data Vibe into a locally recognized Meme is a key mechanism for learning and abstraction in the system. An observed successful interaction (a Data Vibe) can be captured by a Vessel and made reusable as one of its Memes.

> **Alice:** "So if my Vessel sees a Data Vibe that perfectly shows how to, say, draft a polite refusal, it can just say, 'Okay, that's my new PoliteRefusalMeme'?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! Locally, for that Vessel, that Data Vibe _is_ now the PoliteRefusalMeme. Its original schema defines the tool, and its input and solution are the perfect 'how-to' example. No central committee needed."
> **Alice:** "So if my Vessel sees a few different Data Vibes that are all, say, good ways to summarize meetings – same _kind_ of task, so same schema – but based on different meeting notes as input?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! It can look at all those successful summarization examples (different inputs, different solutions, but all for the `SummarizeMeetingSchema`) and create a single, more versatile `SummarizeMeetingMeme` that has learned from all of them how to handle various types of meeting content."





### 2. Activation and Utilization

Once a Meme is defined (either adopted from a Data Vibe or created through multi-example learning), it becomes an active capability for the Vessel. How this capability is invoked and used depends on the LLM's understanding of the context and any compositional arrangements:

- **Direct Activation by LLM:** The LLM, understanding the Meme's function (derived from its schema and example usage), may decide to populate its schema and request its execution directly based on the current conversational context. For example, if a `SummarizeMeeting` Meme exists, an LLM might choose to use it when a meeting transcript is provided.
- **Activation via Composition (using other Memes):** The real power of Memes emerges in their ability to be composed. A functional Meme (like `SummarizeMeeting`) can be activated as part of a larger compositional structure:
  - **Helper or Gating Memes:** These Memes (which are themselves defined by JSON Schemas) can implement specific conditional logic. For instance, a Meme intended to provide weather information might be composed with another Meme that first checks if a location has been specified. If the LLM activates this composed structure, the "location check" Meme would execute, and only if a location is present would the "weather information" Meme be subsequently filled and executed.
  - **Trigger Memes:** These are a specific category of helper Memes that provide explicit activation conditions, often based on time or external events. For example, a `WeeklySchedulerMeme` could activate every Monday at 9 AM and, in turn, activate a `ScheduleTeamCall` Meme, passing in necessary parameters.

This compositional approach—Memes being orchestrated or gated by other Memes—allows for sophisticated and context-aware tool usage, all driven by the LLM's interaction with these structured capabilities. The fundamental definition of a Meme as a JSON Schema-defined tool aligns with standard LLM tools, but our system emphasizes this compositional approach to guide and structure the LLM's decision-making process for tool usage.

> **Alice:** "So once my Vessel has a Meme, its LLM can just decide to use it when it makes sense in the conversation?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly. Or, we can get fancier. We could have a 'SentimentGuardMeme' that, if it detects you're about to send something harsh, automatically suggests or even uses your 'PoliteRefusalMeme' instead. That's composition!"
> **Alice:** "And the trigger Memes are like alarms that can kick off other Memes automatically?"
> **Bob:** "You got it! Like setting a Meme to run every morning to fetch the news. The trigger handles the 'when,' and the target Meme handles the 'what'."





### 3. Metrics and Evaluation

A crucial part of a Meme's lifecycle is understanding its performance and impact. This is achieved by embedding metrics directly into the Meme's definition and an ongoing evaluation process.

- **Embedded Metrics Collection:** Any Meme, whether it's a functional target Meme or a helper/gating Meme, can be designed to record operational metrics. This is achieved by including specially designated fields within its JSON schema. By convention, fields in a Meme's schema that start with a `$` prefix (e.g., `"$activationCount"`, `"$itemsProcessed"`, `"$lastErrorCode"`) are treated as metric fields.
- **Dynamic Population by LLM:** When a Meme is activated and its schema is "filled" (either by an LLM, a Vessel's internal logic, or another Meme), these `$`-prefixed fields can be populated with values. The system can then automatically persist these values, allowing for tracking and analysis.
- **Rich, Qualitative Feedback:** Crucially, because an LLM can be guided to populate these `$`-fields, the recorded metrics are not limited to simple numerical counts or predefined values. The LLM can generate sophisticated, qualitative assessments or AI-driven insights directly into these metric fields.
  - For example, a `ContentModeration` Meme might have a `"$profanityScore": "low"` or `"$sentimentAnalysis": "positive"` field filled by the LLM.
  - A `TaskDecomposition` Meme could output a `"$perceivedComplexity": "high"` or `"$estimatedSubtasks": 5`.
  - A helper Meme gating access could record `"$reasonForDenial": "User lacks permission for XYZ action."`
- **Informing Evaluation:** This provides a flexible and deeply integrated way to gather nuanced statistics and qualitative feedback. This data directly informs the `Evaluate` stage of a Meme's lifecycle. The collected metrics (both quantitative and qualitative AI-generated feedback) are crucial for assessing a Meme's effectiveness: Does it achieve its intended purpose? Is it efficient? Is it well-received?

This rich, AI-generated data stream is vital for understanding how a Meme is performing in the wild and provides the foundation for its subsequent evolution.

> **Alice:** "So, we can build little counters or feedback fields right into the Meme's schema using those dollar-sign thingies?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! And the LLM can fill them out. So it's not just 'used 10 times,' but could be 'used 10 times, average user sentiment: positive, common theme in feedback: users want more detail.'"
> **Alice:** "That sounds super useful for figuring out if a Meme is actually any good or needs tweaking!"
> **Bob:** "Precisely. It's like built-in quality control and a suggestion box, all powered by the LLM's observations during use."





### 4. Evolution and Refinement

Because Memes are so directly tied to Data Vibes (essentially being purposed Data Vibes or created from their examples), their definitions and evolutionary pathways can leverage the Vibe ecosystem's mechanisms for managing change. The evaluation data gathered through metrics provides the impetus and guidance for this evolution.

- **Iterative Refinement:** Based on the evaluation of its performance (driven by metrics and AI-generated feedback), a Meme can be evolved. This is not about changing an existing, immutable Meme instance but about creating a new, improved version. This might involve:
  - Modifying its underlying `schema` (the JSON Schema tool definition) to alter its parameters, behavior, or output structure.
  - Changing the guiding `input` and `solution` examples that illustrate its use, perhaps based on new successful interactions or a broader set of learned examples.
  - Adjusting the natural language instructions, descriptions, or metadata associated with it to make it clearer or more effective.
- **Versioning and Lineage:** This iterative refinement allows Memes to improve over time. Each significant change can result in a new version of the Meme, maintaining a clear lineage. This leverages the Vibe ecosystem's inherent support for versioning. If the underlying Data Vibe(s) that inspired a Meme are versioned, this can also naturally lead to new versions of the Meme.
- **Localized, Self-Driven Evolution:** Furthermore, this evolution can be highly localized and self-driven. The metrics a Meme gathers are not just for external observation; they can be fed back as direct `input` to the Meme itself or to a closely coupled helper Meme. For instance, a Meme designed to generate creative content could include a `"$userRating"` metric. This rating, once gathered, can become part of the `input` for its next activation, allowing the Meme to consider its past performance (e.g., "last output rated 4/5 stars, try similar tone" or "last output rated 1/5, avoid that style"). This creates a direct feedback loop where a Meme can actively participate in its own refinement by using its performance data to adjust its subsequent behavior or output, leading to a form of localized, autonomous adaptation.

The goal is to create a feedback loop: a Meme is used, data is collected, the data is evaluated, and that evaluation informs the creation of a better Meme, which can even use its own performance data as input for further cycles.

> **Alice:** "So if the metrics show my 'MeetingSummarizerMeme' keeps missing action items, I can tweak its schema or give it better examples to create a new version?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! And it gets even more interesting. Those metrics, like a 'userSatisfactionScore', could be fed _back into_ the Meme the next time it runs. So it knows, 'Okay, last time I got a 2 out of 5, I should try a different approach for this summary.' It can start to self-correct."
> **Alice:** "Wow, so the Meme can use its own performance report card to decide how to act next time? That's like a mini-evolution happening on the fly!"
> **Bob:** "You've got it. That's the local evolution part – the Meme actively using its gathered metrics as input for its own activation and behavior, continuously adapting."





### 5. Propagation and Discovery

Once a Meme proves useful or is refined, its availability and adoption by other parts of the system become relevant. This involves both passive discovery and more active forms of propagation.

- **Sharing & Discovery by Vessels:**
  - **Browsing Vibe Storage:** Vessels are capable of browsing the Vibe storage. They can discover useful Data Vibes (which include their `schema`, `input`, and `solution`) and choose to adopt them as new Memes for themselves.
  - **Observing Other Vessels:** Vessels might also observe other Vessels effectively using certain Memes. If a Vessel notices another achieving good results with a particular tool, it might seek out that Meme's definition (its schema and examples) and adopt it.
- **Organic Spread:** A successful and effective Meme can spread organically through the system as more Vessels observe its utility and independently adopt it.
- **Forced Integration/Embedding (User-Defined):** In more structured environments, typically configured by the user, a particularly effective or critical Meme might be "forcefully" integrated or embedded:
  - **Into a Collective:** A Meme could become a standard tool for a **Collective** (a group of Vessels operating under shared rules or a common purpose).
  - **Into a Role Definition:** A Meme could be made an intrinsic part of a **Role** definition. This would mean that new Vessels created to embody that Role would automatically possess that Meme as part of their core capabilities.
- **Active Search:** Vessels can actively search the Vibe storage not just for Data Vibes to turn into Memes, but also for existing, well-defined Memes already in use by other Vessels. This allows for proactive improvement and adaptation by finding proven tools.

This combination of discovery, organic spread, and deliberate integration ensures that valuable Memes can become widely available and utilized, enhancing the overall capabilities of the system.

> **Alice:** "So if my Vessel creates a really awesome Meme, other Vessels can find it and use it too?"
> **Bob:** "They could! They might stumble upon the Data Vibe that inspired it, or even see your Vessel using the Meme and think, 'Hey, I want that tool!'"
> **Alice:** "And I, as the user, could decide that a certain Meme is so important that all Vessels of a certain type should just have it automatically?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly. You could make it part of their 'job description' or standard toolkit for that Role or Collective. That's the forced integration part, ensuring key capabilities are widespread when needed."





## The "Why": User-Defined Worlds for Meme Interaction

The Meme lifecycle describes _how_ Memes are created, used, and evolve. But a common question is: _Why_ would Vessels share Memes? _When_ do they decide to create, adopt, or refine them?

The crucial insight here is that **there is no single, hardcoded answer**. The system is designed as a flexible framework where the _user_ defines the "world" or "regime" in which their Vessels operate. The underlying mechanisms for Meme creation, sharing, and evolution exist, but the motivations and rules governing these interactions are highly configurable by the user.

Users can establish various operational paradigms for their Vessels:

- **"Schools" for Vessels:** Where new Vessels are explicitly taught or equipped with a core set of effective Memes.
- **"Democracies" or "Republics":** Where popular or highly-rated Memes might be voted on and adopted by a collective of Vessels.
- **"Collectivist Societies":** Where improvements to a Meme by one Vessel are automatically propagated to all others in their collective.
- **"Individualistic" or "Competitive" Environments:** Where Vessels might hoard effective Memes or compete to develop superior ones.
- **"Research & Development Labs":** Where Vessels are specifically tasked with actively experimenting, creating, and refining Memes for particular purposes.

This configurability is a core strength of the system. It means the system doesn't impose a single philosophy of interaction. Instead, it provides the tools (Memes and their lifecycle mechanisms) and allows users to design their own "social physics" or "economic models" for how Vessels and Memes interact and evolve. This empowers users to tailor the system to their specific goals, fostering diverse and emergent behaviors based on the rules they define. The power lies in the hands of the user to experiment with different setups and discover what modes of Meme interaction best suit their needs.

> **Alice:** "So the system provides all these ways for Memes to be made, shared, and improved..."
> **Bob:** "...but _why_ any particular Vessel bothers to do any of that is entirely up to the rules and incentives _I_ set up as the user?"
> **Alice:** "Meaning I could make a world where Vessels are super secretive and competitive about their Memes, or one where they're all about open-source sharing and collaboration?"
> **Bob:** "Precisely! You define their 'culture' or 'economic system.' The system just provides the universal mechanics for Memes. Their societal behavior is your design."

## Manifest Content (LLM Instructions)

The term "Meme" is used for its original, academic meaning: a unit of
cultural information that replicates, spreads, and evolves. This aligns with
system Memes as shareable, adaptable tool definitions (ideas/behaviors) that
propagate and are refined within the AI ecosystem, akin to cultural transmission.

---

JSON Schema acts as a blueprint for data, defining its expected structure,
rules, types, and constraints, much like the design for a fillable form.
It ensures predictability when LLMs or processes use Memes (which are JSON
Schemas) by guiding them to provide necessary information correctly.

---

Memes are tools defined by JSON Schemas, detailing their function, parameters,
and output structure. When an LLM uses a Meme, it populates this schema,
creating a structured JSON specification. This specification is a request
for an action, which the system then executes based on the provided details.

---

Memes originate when a Vessel locally adopts a Data Vibe (input, schema,
solution). The Vibe's schema becomes the Meme's JSON Schema tool definition;
its input/solution provide a usage example. This is a local Vessel act.
Vessels can also create more nuanced Memes by observing multiple Data Vibes
that share the same schema but showcase different successful input/solution pairs.

---

Memes are activated directly by an LLM based on context, or via composition
with other Memes. Helper/gating Memes add conditional logic, while trigger
Memes enable scheduled/event-based activation. This compositional use of
JSON Schema-defined tools allows for sophisticated, LLM-driven behaviors.

---

Memes integrate metrics via '$'-prefixed fields in their JSON schema.
When a Meme is used, an LLM can populate these fields with both quantitative
data and qualitative, AI-generated insights (e.g., sentiment analysis,
complexity assessment). This rich data is automatically persisted, directly
informing the Meme's evaluation stage.

---

Memes evolve through iterative refinement driven by metrics and AI feedback.
This creates new versions with updated schemas, examples, or instructions,
leveraging Vibe versioning. Crucially, gathered metrics can also be fed
back as input to the Meme itself, enabling it to consider past performance
for its next activation, fostering localized, autonomous adaptation.

---

Memes propagate via discovery (Vessels browsing Vibe storage or observing
other Vessels) and organic spread due to recognized utility. Users can also
forcefully integrate Memes into Hierarchies or Role definitions. Vessels
can actively search for useful Data Vibes or existing Memes, ensuring
valuable tools become widely available.

---

The motivations for Vessel interactions with Memes (sharing, creation,
refinement) are not hardcoded. Instead, users define the "world" or
operational paradigm (e.g., collaborative, competitive, educational) in
which their Vessels operate. This allows users to configure the "social
physics" governing Meme interactions, tailoring system behavior to their goals.
