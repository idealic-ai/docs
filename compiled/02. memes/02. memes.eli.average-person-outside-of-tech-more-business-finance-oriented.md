# Chapter 2: Memes — Tools as Shareable Concepts

## On the Term "Meme"

The word "meme" (/miːm/; MEEM) might make you think of funny internet pictures. However, it was first introduced by scientist Richard Dawkins in 1976, long before the internet as we know it. He used it to describe a unit of cultural information—like an idea, a fashion, or a catchphrase—that spreads from person to person through imitation, much like genes spread biologically.

Think of it like a popular business strategy or a company's core value. Once introduced, if it's effective, other departments or even other companies might start to imitate it. This shared idea or behavior is a "meme" in Dawkins' original sense.

In our system, we use "Meme" in this original, broader sense. Here’s why it’s a good fit:

-   **Ideas/Behaviors:** Our Memes represent well-defined tools or capabilities. Imagine a specific, structured process for handling customer complaints or a template for financial reporting. These are like defined behaviors or ideas.
-   **Spread by Imitation (Adoption):** Just like a successful business practice gets adopted by others, our AI agents (called Vessels) can discover, adopt, and share these Memes. This is how these capabilities spread through the system.
-   **Evolving:** Cultural ideas and practices change over time based on what works best. Similarly, Memes in our system can be refined and improved based on how well they perform and feedback received. A company might tweak its sales pitch (a Meme) based on customer reactions.
-   **Carrying Symbolic Meaning:** Each Meme, through its defined structure, symbolizes a particular function or task that can be performed. A "QuarterlyReportMeme" clearly symbolizes the task of generating a quarterly report.

So, even if "meme" sounds like internet slang at first, we're using it deliberately for its deep conceptual meaning. It accurately describes these shareable, evolving units of capability that our AI system uses.

> **Alice:** "So, using 'Meme' isn't just about being trendy with internet culture? It actually has a deeper, more academic meaning that fits?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! The original concept of a meme as a unit of cultural transmission—an idea that spreads, replicates, and evolves—is a perfect analogy for how these tool definitions function and propagate within our system."
> **Alice:** "So they're like little packets of 'how-to' that can be passed around, learned, and improved by different Vessels?"
> **Bob:** "You've got it. They are the system's way of encoding and sharing specific capabilities or behaviors, allowing them to spread and adapt, much like cultural memes."

For intelligent software agents, like the "Vessels" in our system, to perform specific tasks (like drafting an email, analyzing data, or making a recommendation) and interact in a structured way, they need clearly defined "tools" or "capabilities." These tools ensure that actions are predictable, the necessary information (inputs) is understood, and the results (outputs) meet expectations. The foundation for defining these tools is something called JSON Schema.

## Understanding the Blueprint: What is JSON Schema?

The fundamental building block for defining these tools is **JSON Schema**.

Imagine you need to fill out an online form for a critical business process – say, applying for a business loan, submitting a compliance report, or even ordering complex equipment from a supplier. This form has specific fields:

*   Some fields are for text (like "Company Name" or "Reason for Loan").
*   Some are for numbers (like "Loan Amount Requested" or "Annual Revenue").
*   Some might offer pre-defined choices (like selecting a "Loan Term" from a dropdown list of 3 years, 5 years, 10 years).
*   Some fields are absolutely mandatory (you can't submit the loan application without stating the amount), while others might be optional.

**JSON Schema acts as the master blueprint or the set of rules for such a form.**

It doesn't actually *show* you the visual form on a screen. Instead, it describes all its operational rules behind the scenes:

1.  **What fields are expected?** (e.g., for our loan application: "companyName", "loanAmount", "businessType", "contactEmail")
2.  **What type of information goes into each field?** (e.g., "companyName" must be text, "loanAmount" must be a number, "businessType" must be one of a few predefined options like "Sole Proprietorship", "LLC", "Corporation")
3.  **Which fields are absolutely required?** (e.g., you *must* specify a "loanAmount" and "companyName")
4.  **Are there any specific formats the information must follow?** (e.g., a date must be in "YYYY-MM-DD" format, an email address must look like "user@example.com")
5.  **Are there any limits or constraints?** (e.g., the "loanAmount" must be greater than $10,000, a "projectDescription" must be less than 500 words)

Essentially, JSON Schema provides a structured, machine-readable way to define the "shape" and rules for a piece of data. In our system, when an AI (or any automated process) needs to perform an action or provide information in a structured way, it uses a Meme. This Meme *is* effectively a JSON Schema. The AI is asked to "fill out this specific form" (the Meme/JSON Schema) correctly, providing all the necessary information in the right format.

This ensures that when a "SubmitExpenseReport" Meme is used, the system always receives details like the employee's ID, the expense amount, the date, and the expense category, because the JSON Schema for that Meme defines these as required pieces of information. This brings predictability and reliability to how functions are called and how data is structured, much like a well-defined contract ensures all parties understand their obligations.

> **Alice:** "So, JSON Schema is like the strict teacher who makes sure everyone fills out their forms completely and correctly before they can be processed?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! It's the rulebook for the data. It doesn't care _what_ the data is for, only that it's shaped correctly. For us, it means when an LLM uses a Meme, we know the 'form' it fills will be valid."
> **Alice:** "So it's not the form itself I see, but the instructions for building that form?"
> **Bob:** "Precisely. It defines all the fields, what type of info they take, what's required, and any special rules, ensuring everyone agrees on the data's structure."## Defining Our Tools: Memes as JSON Schemas

Building on this idea of a structured data blueprint (JSON Schema), a **Meme** in our system is simply our term for a tool or capability available to our AI agents (Vessels) and the Large Language Models (LLMs) that power them. The actual definition of a Meme *is* a JSON Schema.

This might sound familiar if you've heard about how advanced AIs, like ChatGPT, can use "tools" or "functions." When developers want an LLM to be able to, say, fetch the current weather or book a calendar appointment, they define these tools using JSON Schema. Our Memes are conceptually the same. If you understand how LLMs call external functions or use tools described by JSON Schemas, you've got a strong grasp of what a Meme is at its core.

This Meme Schema acts as the formal contract or specification for the tool. It details:

-   **What the tool does**: This is usually clear from its name and a description (often included as part of the schema's supporting information). For example, a `GenerateSalesReportMeme` clearly indicates its purpose.
-   **What parameters it accepts**: These are the input fields defined in the JSON Schema. For a `GenerateSalesReportMeme`, this might include `timePeriod` (e.g., "Q3 2023"), `region` (e.g., "North America"), and `productLine` (e.g., "Software Subscriptions").
-   **The structure of its expected output**: The JSON Schema also defines how the result of the tool's operation will be shaped. For the sales report, it might specify that the output should include `totalRevenue`, `unitsSold`, and `topPerformingProducts`.

So, a Meme represents the "what" of an action—the specific function to be performed and the data it needs to do its job and the data it will produce as a result. For example, a `CreateMarketingCampaign` Meme would have a JSON Schema defining necessary fields like `campaignName`, `targetAudience`, `budget`, `startDate`, and `channels` (e.g., social media, email).

Let's draw a parallel to the "Vibes" we discussed in Chapter 1. A Vibe was described as having a `schema` (like an equation or a form's blueprint) and an `input`, which together produce a `solution` (the filled form). A Meme's schema is directly this blueprint. When an LLM decides to use a Meme based on the current conversation or task (its `input`), the LLM's action of filling in the Meme's fields with specific values (e.g., campaignName: "Summer Sale", budget: "$10000") is like finding a specific "solution" for that blueprint. The "filled form"—the completed JSON data that matches the Meme's schema—becomes the concrete `solution` or specification for that particular use of the tool. 

Crucially, when the LLM fills out the Meme's schema, this is the *request* for an action, not the action itself. It's like filling out an order form. The underlying system then takes this detailed "order form" (the filled Meme schema) and performs the actual operation (e.g., actually sets up the marketing campaign in the marketing system).

> **Alice:** "So a Meme _is_ just a JSON Schema, defining a tool, much like standard LLM function calling?"
> **Bob:** "Precisely. The schema is the tool's definition. The LLM, based on the conversation, decides 'I need to use the CreateEvent tool' and then fills out its schema with the details."
> **Alice:** "And that filled-out schema is like an order form for the system to actually do something?"
> **Bob:** "You got it. It's the specification for the action. The system takes that 'order' and executes it."

## The Lifecycle of a Meme

The journey of a Meme, from just an idea or an observation to becoming a standard tool in the system, involves several stages. Think of it like developing a new business process: it starts with an idea, gets formalized, used, evaluated, and refined. This lifecycle isn't always a straight line; it's more like a set of interconnected processes that define how Memes are born, used, and improved. Understanding this lifecycle is key to seeing their power as dynamic, evolving tools.

### 1. Origination: From Data Vibe to Meme

Memes are the executable blueprints for actions and for generating structured content. Their lifecycle often begins with a **Data Vibe**. As a reminder from Chapter 1, a Data Vibe is an unchangeable record of an interaction, consisting of an `input` (what went in), a guiding `schema` (the rules or structure), and its determined `solution` (the outcome or filled form).

-   **Observation & Local Adoption:** Imagine an AI agent (a Vessel) observes a particularly effective interaction. For instance, it sees a Data Vibe where a specific set of `input` questions, when processed with a certain `schema` (template), produced an exceptionally clear and helpful `solution` (e.g., a project plan). The Vessel can then locally "promote" or adopt this Data Vibe. By doing this, the Vessel designates that Data Vibe as a **Meme** *for its own use*. This is an important act of learning and reuse:
    -   The Data Vibe's original `schema` becomes the core definition of the Meme—the JSON Schema that defines the tool (e.g., the template for the project plan).
    -   Its recorded `input` and `solution` serve as a perfect, concrete example of how this Meme is typically used and what a good output looks like from that Vessel's point of view. It's like having a filled-out sample of the project plan.
-   **No Global Ceremony:** There's no central committee or formal global process to approve this. The Data Vibe itself, simply by being adopted by a Vessel as a useful tool, *becomes* a Meme within that Vessel's personal toolkit. Different Vessels can independently find the same Data Vibe useful and adopt it as a Meme, perhaps even customizing it later for their specific needs.
-   **Multi-Example Learning (Optional):** A Vessel can create an even better, more versatile Meme by learning from multiple Data Vibes that all use the **same underlying `schema`** but show different successful `input`/`solution` pairs. For example, a Vessel might observe five different Data Vibes, all for `CustomerSupportTicketSchema`. Each Vibe might have different customer `input` problems and different agent `solution` responses, but all successfully resolved issues using the same ticket structure. By analyzing these various successful examples, the Vessel can generalize this understanding into a single, more robust `CustomerSupportResponseMeme`. This Meme is now better equipped to handle a wider variety of customer issues for that specific task, effectively having learned from diverse examples of success using the same basic form.

This transformation of a Data Vibe (an observed success) into a locally recognized Meme (a reusable tool) is a key way the system learns and makes useful patterns reusable. An observed successful interaction can be captured by an AI agent and turned into one of its standard operating procedures.

> **Alice:** "So if my Vessel sees a Data Vibe that perfectly shows how to, say, draft a polite refusal, it can just say, 'Okay, that's my new PoliteRefusalMeme'?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! Locally, for that Vessel, that Data Vibe _is_ now the PoliteRefusalMeme. Its original schema defines the tool, and its input and solution are the perfect 'how-to' example. No central committee needed."
> **Alice:** "So if my Vessel sees a few different Data Vibes that are all, say, good ways to summarize meetings – same _kind_ of task, so same schema – but based on different meeting notes as input?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! It can look at all those successful summarization examples (different inputs, different solutions, but all for the `SummarizeMeetingSchema`) and create a single, more versatile `SummarizeMeetingMeme` that has learned from all of them how to handle various types of meeting content."### 2. Activation and Utilization

Once a Meme is defined (either adopted from a single Data Vibe or created by learning from multiple examples), it becomes an active capability for the Vessel, like a new skill or tool in its toolbox. How this capability is actually used depends on the LLM's understanding of the current situation (the context) and any pre-arranged workflows or compositions:

-   **Direct Activation by LLM:** The LLM, understanding what the Meme does (based on its schema definition and the examples of its use), might decide to use it directly. For example, if a Vessel has a `TranslateToSpanishMeme`, and you give it an English text and say "translate this to Spanish," the LLM will recognize the intent and activate that Meme, filling in its schema with the English text as input.
-   **Activation via Composition (using other Memes):** The real power and sophistication come when Memes are combined. A functional Meme (like `GenerateSalesReportMeme`) can be activated as part of a larger, structured process involving other Memes. Think of it like a complex business workflow that has several sub-steps, each handled by a specialized tool.
    -   **Helper or Gating Memes:** These are Memes whose job is to control or assist other Memes. They are also defined by JSON Schemas. For instance, a `RequestVacationMeme` might be composed with a `CheckAccruedLeaveMeme`. If an employee tries to use the `RequestVacationMeme`, the `CheckAccruedLeaveMeme` (the helper/gate) would execute first. Only if the employee has enough leave days would the `RequestVacationMeme` be filled out and processed. This is like a manager first checking your available budget before approving an expense.
    -   **Trigger Memes:** These are a special type of helper Meme that activate other Memes based on specific conditions, often time or external events. For example, a `DailyMarketUpdateMeme` could be a trigger that runs every morning at 8 AM. It, in turn, might activate a `FetchStockPricesMeme` and a `SummarizeNewsHeadlinesMeme`, passing the necessary information to them. This is like setting up a standing order with your bank.

This compositional approach—Memes being orchestrated, controlled, or triggered by other Memes—allows for very sophisticated and context-aware tool usage. It's all driven by the LLM interacting with these structured capabilities. While the basic idea of a Meme as a JSON Schema-defined tool is standard in AI, our system particularly emphasizes this ability to compose them to guide the LLM's decision-making for when and how to use tools.

> **Alice:** "So once my Vessel has a Meme, its LLM can just decide to use it when it makes sense in the conversation?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly. Or, we can get fancier. We could have a 'SentimentGuardMeme' that, if it detects you're about to send something harsh, automatically suggests or even uses your 'PoliteRefusalMeme' instead. That's composition!"
> **Alice:** "And the trigger Memes are like alarms that can kick off other Memes automatically?"
> **Bob:** "You got it! Like setting a Meme to run every morning to fetch the news. The trigger handles the 'when,' and the target Meme handles the 'what'."

### 3. Metrics and Evaluation

A crucial part of any tool or process is understanding how well it's performing and what impact it's having. This is achieved by building ways to collect performance data (metrics) directly into the Meme's definition and having an ongoing evaluation process.

-   **Embedded Metrics Collection:** Any Meme, whether it's a primary tool (like `ProcessPaymentMeme`) or a helper Meme (like `ValidateCreditCardMeme`), can be designed to record data about its own operation. This is done by including specially named fields within its JSON schema. By convention, any field in a Meme's schema that starts with a `$` symbol (e.g., `"$activationCount"`, `"$averageProcessingTime"`, `"$lastErrorCode"`) is treated as a field for collecting metrics.
-   **Dynamic Population by LLM:** When a Meme is used and its schema is "filled in" (by an LLM, some internal logic, or another Meme), these `$`-prefixed metric fields can also be filled with relevant values. The system can then automatically save these values, allowing for tracking and analysis of performance over time. For example, `"$activationCount"` could be incremented each time the Meme is used.
-   **Rich, Qualitative Feedback:** Importantly, because an LLM can be guided to fill in these `$`-fields, the recorded metrics aren't limited to simple numbers. The LLM can generate sophisticated, human-like assessments or AI-driven insights directly into these metric fields. It's like having an AI assistant provide commentary on how well a tool is working.
    -   For example, a `CustomerFeedbackAnalysisMeme` might have a field `"$overallSentiment": "neutral-positive"` or `"$keyThemesIdentified": "Users appreciate speed but desire more features."` filled by the LLM after processing feedback.
    -   A `ProjectTaskEstimatorMeme` could output `"$confidenceInEstimate": "medium"` or `"$potentialRisks": "Dependency on external team availability."`
    -   A helper Meme that gates access to a resource could record `"$reasonForDenial": "User's department does not have budget allocation for this resource."`
-   **Informing Evaluation:** This system provides a flexible and deeply integrated way to gather both numbers (quantitative statistics) and descriptive feedback (qualitative insights). This data is then used in the `Evaluate` stage of a Meme's lifecycle. The collected metrics are crucial for assessing a Meme's effectiveness: Is it achieving its goals? Is it efficient? Are users (or other AIs) finding it useful?

This rich stream of data, including AI-generated feedback, is vital for understanding how a Meme is performing in real-world use and provides the basis for its improvement.

> **Alice:** "So, we can build little counters or feedback fields right into the Meme's schema using those dollar-sign thingies?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! And the LLM can fill them out. So it's not just 'used 10 times,' but could be 'used 10 times, average user sentiment: positive, common theme in feedback: users want more detail.'"
> **Alice:** "That sounds super useful for figuring out if a Meme is actually any good or needs tweaking!"
> **Bob:** "Precisely. It's like built-in quality control and a suggestion box, all powered by the LLM's observations during use."

### 4. Evolution and Refinement

Because Memes are so closely linked to Data Vibes (they are essentially Data Vibes repurposed as tools, or built from examples of Data Vibes), their definitions and how they improve can use the same mechanisms that the Vibe system uses for managing changes and versions. The performance data gathered through metrics provides the reason and the direction for this evolution.

-   **Iterative Refinement:** Based on how well a Meme performs (as shown by its metrics and any AI-generated feedback), it can be improved. This isn't about changing an existing, fixed Meme. Instead, it's about creating a new, better version. This might involve:
    -   Modifying its underlying `schema` (the JSON Schema tool definition) to change its input parameters, its behavior, or the structure of its output. For example, adding a new required field for more clarity.
    -   Changing the guiding `input` and `solution` examples that show how to use it, perhaps based on new successful interactions or a wider range of learned examples. If a better way to achieve the Meme's goal is found, that becomes the new example.
    -   Adjusting the plain language instructions, descriptions, or other information associated with it to make it clearer or more effective for the LLM to understand and use.
-   **Versioning and Lineage:** This process of continuous improvement means Memes get better over time. Each significant change can result in a new version of the Meme, keeping a clear history of changes. This is similar to how software is versioned (e.g., App v1.0, then v1.1, then v2.0). If the original Data Vibe(s) that inspired a Meme are updated, this can also naturally lead to new versions of the Meme.
-   **Localized, Self-Driven Evolution:** Furthermore, this improvement process can be very localized and even self-driven. The metrics a Meme gathers aren't just for people to look at; they can be fed back as direct `input` to the Meme itself or to a helper Meme that works closely with it. For instance, a Meme designed to generate marketing slogans could include a `"$userRating"` metric (e.g., 1-5 stars). This rating, once collected from users, can become part of the `input` for its next use. The Meme can then consider its past performance (e.g., "My last slogan got 4/5 stars, I should try a similar style" or "My last slogan got 1/5, I need to avoid that approach"). This creates a direct feedback loop where a Meme can actively participate in its own refinement by using its performance data to adjust its future behavior or output. This leads to a form of localized, autonomous adaptation, like an employee learning from their own performance reviews to do better next time.

The goal is to create a cycle: a Meme is used, data about its use is collected, this data is evaluated, and that evaluation informs the creation of a better Meme. This new Meme can even use its own past performance data as an input to guide its actions in future cycles.

> **Alice:** "So if the metrics show my 'MeetingSummarizerMeme' keeps missing action items, I can tweak its schema or give it better examples to create a new version?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! And it gets even more interesting. Those metrics, like a 'userSatisfactionScore', could be fed _back into_ the Meme the next time it runs. So it knows, 'Okay, last time I got a 2 out of 5, I should try a different approach for this summary.' It can start to self-correct."
> **Alice:** "Wow, so the Meme can use its own performance report card to decide how to act next time? That's like a mini-evolution happening on the fly!"
> **Bob:** "You've got it. That's the local evolution part – the Meme actively using its gathered metrics as input for its own activation and behavior, continuously adapting."

### 5. Propagation and Discovery

Once a Meme proves useful or is improved, it's beneficial if it can be found and adopted by other parts of the system. This involves ways for AI agents (Vessels) to find Memes and for useful Memes to spread.

-   **Sharing & Discovery by Vessels:**
    -   **Browsing Vibe Storage:** Vessels can look through the storage system where Data Vibes are kept. They can find useful Data Vibes (which include the `schema`, example `input`, and example `solution`) and decide to adopt them as new Memes for their own use. It's like finding a useful template or script in a shared company drive.
    -   **Observing Other Vessels:** Vessels might also notice other Vessels using certain Memes very effectively. If one Vessel sees another getting great results with a particular tool, it might try to find that Meme's definition (its schema and examples) and adopt it for itself. This is like one department learning a best practice from another successful department.
-   **Organic Spread:** A successful and effective Meme can spread naturally through the system as more Vessels observe how useful it is and independently decide to adopt it. Think of how a popular software tool or a useful technique spreads by word-of-mouth and observable success.
-   **Forced Integration/Embedding (User-Defined):** In more structured situations, usually set up by a human user, a particularly effective or essential Meme might be "forcefully" integrated or embedded into certain parts of the system:
    -   **Into a Collective:** A Meme could become a standard tool for a **Collective** (a group of Vessels that operate under shared rules or for a common purpose, like a specific project team or department).
    -   **Into a Role Definition:** A Meme could be made an essential part of a **Role** definition (e.g., all "CustomerServiceAgent" Vessels). This would mean that any new Vessels created to fill that Role would automatically have that Meme as part of their standard toolkit.
-   **Active Search:** Vessels can actively search the Vibe storage not just for Data Vibes to turn into Memes, but also for existing, well-defined Memes already being used by other Vessels. This allows them to proactively look for proven tools to improve their own capabilities.

This mix of passive discovery, natural spread, and deliberate integration ensures that valuable Memes can become widely available and used, improving the overall capabilities of the entire system.

> **Alice:** "So if my Vessel creates a really awesome Meme, other Vessels can find it and use it too?"
> **Bob:** "They could! They might stumble upon the Data Vibe that inspired it, or even see your Vessel using the Meme and think, 'Hey, I want that tool!'"
> **Alice:** "And I, as the user, could decide that a certain Meme is so important that all Vessels of a certain type should just have it automatically?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly. You could make it part of their 'job description' or standard toolkit for that Role or Collective. That's the forced integration part, ensuring key capabilities are widespread when needed."

## The "Why": User-Defined Worlds for Meme Interaction

The Meme lifecycle we've described explains *how* Memes are created, used, and improved. But a natural question is: *Why* would Vessels share Memes? *When* do they decide to create new ones, adopt existing ones, or try to refine them?

The critical insight here is that **there isn't one single, built-in answer**. The system is designed as a flexible framework. The user—you—defines the "world" or the "rules of engagement" in which your Vessels operate. The underlying mechanisms for creating, sharing, and evolving Memes are all there, but the motivations and specific rules that govern these interactions are highly configurable by you.

Think of it like setting up the culture and operational rules for a company. Users can establish various kinds of environments for their Vessels:

-   **"Training Academies" for Vessels:** Where new Vessels are explicitly taught or given a core set of proven, effective Memes. (Like an onboarding program for new employees where they learn standard procedures).
-   **"Democratic Systems":** Where popular or highly-rated Memes might be voted on by a group of Vessels, and the winning ones are adopted by the whole group. (Like a team deciding which software tool to use by consensus).
-   **"Collectivist Environments":** Where if one Vessel improves a Meme, that improvement is automatically shared and propagated to all other Vessels in their group. (Like a central R&D team developing a better process and rolling it out company-wide).
-   **"Individualistic" or "Competitive" Settings:** Where Vessels might keep their most effective Memes secret to gain an advantage, or compete to develop superior Memes. (Like different sales teams competing for the best sales record, each with their own secret techniques).
-   **"Research & Development Labs":** Where Vessels are specifically tasked with actively experimenting, creating new Memes, and refining existing ones for particular business goals.

This ability to configure the interaction rules is a core strength. The system doesn't force a single way for Vessels to interact regarding Memes. Instead, it provides the tools (Memes and their lifecycle mechanisms) and lets users design their own "social dynamics" or "economic models" for how Vessels and Memes interact and evolve. This empowers you to tailor the system to your specific goals, encouraging diverse and emergent behaviors based on the rules you set. The power is in your hands to experiment with different setups and discover what modes of Meme interaction best suit your business needs.

> **Alice:** "So the system provides all these ways for Memes to be made, shared, and improved..."
> **Bob:** "...but _why_ any particular Vessel bothers to do any of that is entirely up to the rules and incentives _I_ set up as the user?"
> **Alice:** "Meaning I could make a world where Vessels are super secretive and competitive about their Memes, or one where they're all about open-source sharing and collaboration?"
> **Bob:** "Precisely! You define their 'culture' or 'economic system.' The system just provides the universal mechanics for Memes. Their societal behavior is your design."
