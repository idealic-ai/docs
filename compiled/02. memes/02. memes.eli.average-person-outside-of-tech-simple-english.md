# Chapter 2: Memes — Tools as Shareable Concepts

## On the Term "Meme"

The word "meme" (you say it like MEEM) might make you think of funny pictures on the internet. But it actually has an older, deeper meaning. Richard Dawkins, a scientist, first used it in 1976. He said a meme is like an idea or a piece of culture that spreads from person to person, similar to how genes pass on traits in biology.

Think of it like a catchy song or a new fashion style that everyone starts copying. That's a meme in its original sense – an idea, behavior, or style that spreads through imitation and often means something special within a culture.

In the system we're talking about, "Memes" are very much like this original idea:

-   **They are Ideas/Behaviors:** Memes in this system are like defined tools or skills. For example, a Meme could be a specific way to write an email or a structured way to store information about a customer.
-   **They Spread by Imitation (or Adoption):** Special AI agents in this system, called Vessels, can find these Memes, learn to use them (adopt them), and even share them. This is how Memes spread throughout the system.
-   **They Can Evolve:** Just like a song might get remixed or a fashion style changes over time, these system Memes can be updated and improved based on how well they work.
-   **They Carry Symbolic Meaning:** Each Meme has a description (called a schema) that explains what it does. This description is like a symbol for a specific task or function that can be performed, such as 'Create a Meeting Invitation' or 'Summarize a Document'.

So, even if "meme" sounds like internet slang, it's used here because it perfectly describes these shareable, evolving instructions or capabilities within this AI world.

> **Alice:** "So, using 'Meme' isn't just about being trendy with internet culture? It actually has a deeper, more academic meaning that fits?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! The original concept of a meme as a unit of cultural transmission—an idea that spreads, replicates, and evolves—is a perfect analogy for how these tool definitions function and propagate within our system."
> **Alice:** "So they're like little packets of 'how-to' that can be passed around, learned, and improved by different Vessels?"
> **Bob:** "You've got it. They are the system's way of encoding and sharing specific capabilities or behaviors, allowing them to spread and adapt, much like cultural memes."

## Understanding the Blueprint: What is JSON Schema?

For smart computer programs (called Large Language Models or LLMs) and the AI agents in our system (like Vessels) to do specific jobs and work together smoothly, they need clear instructions for their "tools" or "capabilities." These instructions help ensure that when they perform an action, it's predictable, they understand what information they need (inputs), and what their results should look like (outputs).

The main way these tools are defined is using something called **JSON Schema**.

Imagine you're filling out an online form – maybe to send money to a friend, book a plane ticket, or sign up for a new app. This form has different boxes to fill in:
*   Some for text (like your name or the friend's name).
*   Some for numbers (like the amount of money or your flight number).
*   Some where you pick from a list (like choosing a country).
*   Some boxes are essential (you *must* fill them in), while others are optional.

**JSON Schema is like the master blueprint for that online form.**

It doesn't actually *show* you the form on a screen. Instead, it describes all the rules for how the form works:

1.  **What boxes (fields) are needed?** (e.g., for sending money, you need "recipientName", "amount", "currency"; for a flight, "departureCity", "destinationCity").
2.  **What kind of information goes in each box?** (e.g., "recipientName" must be text, "amount" must be a number, "currency" must be one of the choices like "USD", "EUR", or "GBP").
3.  **Which boxes absolutely *must* be filled in?** (e.g., you can't send money without saying *how much* money).
4.  **Are there any special formats for the information?** (e.g., a date needs to be written like "YYYY-MM-DD", or an email address must look like "user@example.com").
5.  **Are there any limits?** (e.g., the money "amount" must be more than zero, or a "password" needs to be at least 8 characters long).

Basically, JSON Schema is a structured way to define the "shape" and rules for a set of information. In this AI system, when an LLM (or any part of the system) needs to do something or provide information in a structured way, it uses a Meme. And that Meme *is* a JSON Schema, acting as its guide.

The LLM is essentially asked to "fill out a specific form" (the Meme, which is defined by a JSON Schema) correctly, making sure all the needed information is there and in the right format.

This makes sure that when a "SendMoney" Meme is used, the system always gets the recipient's name, the amount, and the currency. Why? Because the JSON Schema for that Meme says these pieces of information are required. This makes the system reliable and predictable in how it works.

> **Alice:** "So, JSON Schema is like the strict teacher who makes sure everyone fills out their forms completely and correctly before they can be processed?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! It's the rulebook for the data. It doesn't care _what_ the data is for, only that it's shaped correctly. For us, it means when an LLM uses a Meme, we know the 'form' it fills will be valid."
> **Alice:** "So it's not the form itself I see, but the instructions for building that form?"
> **Bob:** "Precisely. It defines all the fields, what type of info they take, what's required, and any special rules, ensuring everyone agrees on the data's structure."## Defining Our Tools: Memes as JSON Schemas

Building on this idea of structured information, a **Meme** in our system is simply the name we give to a tool or capability that these AI agents (Vessels) and smart programs (LLMs) can use. The definition of this tool—what it is and how it works—*is* a JSON Schema.

This might sound familiar if you've heard about how AI like ChatGPT can use "tools" or "functions." When people in the AI world talk about "LLM Tools" or "function calling," they are often talking about using JSON Schema to describe these tools. A Meme in our system is essentially the same core idea.

This Meme Schema (the JSON Schema that defines the Meme) acts like a contract or a detailed instruction manual for the tool. It specifies:

-   **What the tool does:** This is usually clear from its name and a description (which can be part of the schema's information).
-   **What information it needs to work (parameters):** These are the input fields defined in the JSON Schema, like the boxes on a form.
-   **What the result will look like (output structure):** The JSON Schema also defines how the output or result of the tool's action will be organized.

So, a Meme tells you "what" an action is all about—the specific job to be done, the information it needs to do that job, and the information it will produce. For example, a Meme called `CreateEvent` (which is an LLM tool) would have a JSON Schema listing fields like `eventName`, `dateTime` (when it happens), `location`, and `description`.

Think back to Chapter 1, where we talked about "Vibes." A Vibe had a `schema` (like an equation or a blueprint for a form). When the AI system used its intelligence (`input`) with that schema, it produced a `solution` (like a filled-out form). A Meme works similarly. The Meme's Schema is the blueprint of the tool. When the LLM decides to use this Meme based on the current situation (its `input`), the LLM fills in the Meme's fields with specific values. This act of filling it out is like finding a "solution" for that tool.

The "filled form"—the complete set of information matching the Meme's Schema—becomes the specific instruction, or `solution`, for that particular use of the tool. So, just like a Vibe's `schema(input)` gives a `solution`, a Meme's `Schema(LLM's understanding of the situation)` gives a specific, filled-out request to use a tool. Importantly, when the LLM fills out the schema, it's just *asking* for something to be done; it's not doing it itself. The main system then takes this detailed request and performs the actual task.

> **Alice:** "So a Meme _is_ just a JSON Schema, defining a tool, much like standard LLM function calling?"
> **Bob:** "Precisely. The schema is the tool's definition. The LLM, based on the conversation, decides 'I need to use the CreateEvent tool' and then fills out its schema with the details."
> **Alice:** "And that filled-out schema is like an order form for the system to actually do something?"
> **Bob:** "You got it. It's the specification for the action. The system takes that 'order' and executes it."

## The Lifecycle of a Meme

A Meme goes through a journey, from a simple idea to a useful tool that's part of how the system works. This journey isn't always a straight line, but a series of connected steps that show how Memes are created, used, and improved. Understanding this lifecycle helps us see how powerful and flexible these dynamic, evolving tools are.

### 1. Origination: From Data Vibe to Meme

Memes are like the working blueprints for actions or creating content. Their life often starts with something called a **Data Vibe**. As we learned in Chapter 1, a Data Vibe is a permanent record of an interaction: it contains an `input` (what started it), a `schema` (the rules or structure it followed), and a `solution` (the outcome).

-   **Observation & Local Adoption:** An AI agent (a Vessel) might see a particular Data Vibe and realize it's very useful. The Vessel can then decide to "promote" or adopt this Data Vibe locally. When it does this, the Data Vibe becomes a **Meme** *for that specific Vessel*. This is like the Vessel saying, "Hey, this specific recipe (Data Vibe) is so good, I'm going to save it as my go-to 'Chocolate Cake Meme'."
    -   The Data Vibe's original `schema` (the rules of the recipe) becomes the main definition of the Meme tool.
    -   Its recorded `input` and `solution` (the ingredients used and the cake that resulted) serve as a perfect, real-world example of how to use this Meme and what kind of result to expect from that Vessel's point of view.
-   **No Global Ceremony:** There's no big, official event to turn a Data Vibe into a Meme for everyone. It’s a local decision by a Vessel. The Data Vibe itself, once adopted by a Vessel as a tool, *becomes* a Meme in that Vessel's own toolkit. Different Vessels can independently adopt the same Data Vibe, each treating it as their own Meme, and maybe even tweaking it later for their own purposes.
-   **Learning from Multiple Examples (Optional):** A Vessel can create an even better, more adaptable Meme by looking at several Data Vibes. These Data Vibes would all use the **same underlying `schema`** (like different attempts at baking a chocolate cake using the same basic recipe structure) but show different successful `input`/`solution` pairs (different specific ingredients or slightly different baking conditions leading to good cakes). By seeing various ways a "form" (the schema) can be successfully "filled out" in different situations (inputs), the Vessel can create a single, more robust Meme. This Meme is now better at handling a wider variety of situations for that specific task because it has learned from many diverse examples of success for the same basic job.

This process of turning a Data Vibe into a locally recognized Meme is a really important way the system learns and gets smarter. An observed successful interaction (a Data Vibe) can be grabbed by a Vessel and turned into a reusable tool (a Meme) in its own collection.

> **Alice:** "So if my Vessel sees a Data Vibe that perfectly shows how to, say, draft a polite refusal, it can just say, 'Okay, that's my new PoliteRefusalMeme'?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! Locally, for that Vessel, that Data Vibe _is_ now the PoliteRefusalMeme. Its original schema defines the tool, and its input and solution are the perfect 'how-to' example. No central committee needed."
> **Alice:** "So if my Vessel sees a few different Data Vibes that are all, say, good ways to summarize meetings – same _kind_ of task, so same schema – but based on different meeting notes as input?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! It can look at all those successful summarization examples (different inputs, different solutions, but all for the `SummarizeMeetingSchema`) and create a single, more versatile `SummarizeMeetingMeme` that has learned from all of them how to handle various types of meeting content."

### 2. Activation and Utilization

Once a Meme is defined (either by adopting a Data Vibe or by learning from several examples), it becomes an active skill or tool for the Vessel. How this tool is actually used depends on the AI's understanding of the current situation and how different Memes might be set up to work together:

-   **Direct Activation by LLM:** The LLM (the AI's brain), understanding what the Meme does (from its schema and example), might decide to use it directly if it fits the ongoing conversation or task. For instance, if a `SummarizeMeeting` Meme exists, and the AI is given a meeting transcript, it might choose to use that Meme.
-   **Activation via Composition (using other Memes):** The real cleverness of Memes comes from how they can be combined. A useful Meme (like `SummarizeMeeting`) can be activated as part of a larger setup involving other Memes:
    -   **Helper or Gating Memes:** These are other Memes (also defined by JSON Schemas) that act like assistants or gatekeepers. They can apply specific rules or conditions. For example, a Meme designed to give weather information might be combined with another Meme that first checks if a location has been provided. If the AI tries to use this combined setup, the "location check" Meme would run first. Only if a location is actually present would the "weather information" Meme then be filled out and used.
    -   **Trigger Memes:** These are special helper Memes that set specific conditions for when another Meme should start working, often based on time or outside events. For example, a `WeeklySchedulerMeme` could be set to run every Monday at 9 AM. When it runs, it could then activate a `ScheduleTeamCall` Meme, automatically providing it with the necessary information.

This way of combining Memes—where some Memes control or manage others—allows for very smart and context-aware use of tools, all guided by the AI's interactions with these structured capabilities. While the basic idea of a Meme as a JSON Schema-defined tool is similar to standard LLM tools, this system particularly highlights using them together in these composed structures to guide the AI's decisions about when and how to use tools.

> **Alice:** "So once my Vessel has a Meme, its LLM can just decide to use it when it makes sense in the conversation?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly. Or, we can get fancier. We could have a 'SentimentGuardMeme' that, if it detects you're about to send something harsh, automatically suggests or even uses your 'PoliteRefusalMeme' instead. That's composition!"
> **Alice:** "And the trigger Memes are like alarms that can kick off other Memes automatically?"
> **Bob:** "You got it! Like setting a Meme to run every morning to fetch the news. The trigger handles the 'when,' and the target Meme handles the 'what'."### 3. Metrics and Evaluation

A very important part of a Meme's life is understanding how well it's working and what effect it's having. This is done by building ways to measure performance right into the Meme's definition and by constantly evaluating it.

-   **Embedded Metrics Collection:** Any Meme, whether it's a main tool or a helper/gatekeeper Meme, can be designed to keep track of how it's operating. This is done by including special fields in its JSON schema (its blueprint). By agreement, any field in a Meme's schema that starts with a `$` sign (like `"$activationCount"` for how many times it's used, `"$itemsProcessed"` for how much work it did, or `"$lastErrorCode"` if something went wrong) is treated as a field for collecting metrics.
-   **Dynamic Population by LLM:** When a Meme is used and its schema is "filled in" (either by the AI brain, the Vessel's own logic, or another Meme), these `$`-fields can be filled with values. The system can then automatically save these values, allowing them to be tracked and analyzed later. Think of it like a car's dashboard logging mileage and fuel consumption automatically.
-   **Rich, Qualitative Feedback:** What's really powerful is that because the AI brain (LLM) can be guided to fill in these `$`-fields, the information collected isn't just simple numbers. The LLM can provide sophisticated, human-like assessments or insights directly into these metric fields.
    -   For example, a `ContentModeration` Meme (a tool for checking content) might have a field like `"$profanityScore": "low"` or `"$sentimentAnalysis": "positive"` filled in by the LLM.
    -   A `TaskDecomposition` Meme (a tool for breaking big tasks into smaller ones) could output something like `"$perceivedComplexity": "high"` or `"$estimatedSubtasks": 5`.
    -   A helper Meme that controls access to something could record `"$reasonForDenial": "User lacks permission for XYZ action."`
-   **Informing Evaluation:** This system provides a flexible and deeply built-in way to gather detailed statistics and insightful feedback. This data is then used directly in the `Evaluate` stage of a Meme's lifecycle. The collected metrics (both numbers and AI-generated opinions) are essential for judging how effective a Meme is: Does it do what it's supposed to do? Is it efficient? Do users (or other AIs) find it helpful?

This rich stream of data, partly generated by the AI itself, is vital for understanding how a Meme is performing in real situations and provides the basis for improving it later.

> **Alice:** "So, we can build little counters or feedback fields right into the Meme's schema using those dollar-sign thingies?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! And the LLM can fill them out. So it's not just 'used 10 times,' but could be 'used 10 times, average user sentiment: positive, common theme in feedback: users want more detail.'"
> **Alice:** "That sounds super useful for figuring out if a Meme is actually any good or needs tweaking!"
> **Bob:** "Precisely. It's like built-in quality control and a suggestion box, all powered by the LLM's observations during use."

### 4. Evolution and Refinement

Because Memes are closely linked to Data Vibes (they are essentially Data Vibes given a specific purpose, or created from examples of Data Vibes), how they are defined and how they change can use the same systems that manage changes in the Vibe ecosystem. The information gathered through metrics provides the reason and the guidance for this evolution.

-   **Iterative Refinement:** Based on how well it performs (judged by metrics and AI-generated feedback), a Meme can be improved. This isn't about changing an existing Meme that's already out there (those are usually kept as a record). Instead, it’s about creating a new, better version. This might involve:
    -   Changing its underlying `schema` (the JSON Schema tool definition) to alter what information it needs, how it behaves, or what its output looks like.
    -   Updating the guiding `input` and `solution` examples that show how it's used, perhaps based on new successful uses or a wider range of learned examples.
    -   Adjusting the plain language instructions, descriptions, or other information associated with it to make it clearer or more effective.
-   **Versioning and Lineage:** This process of making improvements step-by-step allows Memes to get better over time. Each significant change can result in a new version of the Meme, keeping a clear history of how it has evolved. This takes advantage of the Vibe system's built-in support for keeping track of versions. If the Data Vibes that originally inspired a Meme are versioned, this can also naturally lead to new versions of the Meme.
-   **Localized, Self-Driven Evolution:** Furthermore, this evolution can happen in a very specific, self-guided way. The metrics a Meme collects aren't just for others to look at; they can be fed back as direct `input` to the Meme itself, or to a helper Meme that works closely with it. For instance, a Meme designed to generate creative content could include a `"$userRating"` metric. This rating, once collected, can become part of the `input` for its next use. This allows the Meme to consider its past performance (e.g., "my last output was rated 4 out of 5 stars, I should try a similar tone" or "my last output got 1 out of 5, I need to avoid that style"). This creates a direct feedback loop where a Meme can actively help refine itself by using its performance data to adjust what it does next. This leads to a kind of local, automatic adaptation.

The goal is to create a cycle: a Meme is used, data about its use is collected, this data is evaluated, and that evaluation helps create a better Meme. This improved Meme can even use its own performance data as input to guide itself in future cycles.

> **Alice:** "So if the metrics show my 'MeetingSummarizerMeme' keeps missing action items, I can tweak its schema or give it better examples to create a new version?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly! And it gets even more interesting. Those metrics, like a 'userSatisfactionScore', could be fed _back into_ the Meme the next time it runs. So it knows, 'Okay, last time I got a 2 out of 5, I should try a different approach for this summary.' It can start to self-correct."
> **Alice:** "Wow, so the Meme can use its own performance report card to decide how to act next time? That's like a mini-evolution happening on the fly!"
> **Bob:** "You've got it. That's the local evolution part – the Meme actively using its gathered metrics as input for its own activation and behavior, continuously adapting."

### 5. Propagation and Discovery

Once a Meme is found to be useful or is improved, it's important that other parts of the system can find and use it. This happens through both casual discovery and more deliberate ways of sharing.

-   **Sharing & Discovery by Vessels:**
    -   **Browsing Vibe Storage:** AI agents (Vessels) can look through the storage where Data Vibes are kept. They might find useful Data Vibes (which include their `schema`, `input`, and `solution`) and choose to adopt them as new Memes for themselves.
    -   **Observing Other Vessels:** Vessels might also see other Vessels successfully using certain Memes. If one Vessel notices another getting good results with a particular tool, it might look for that Meme's definition (its schema and examples) and adopt it.
-   **Organic Spread:** A successful and effective Meme can spread naturally through the system as more Vessels see how useful it is and decide to adopt it on their own. Think of how a popular app spreads by word-of-mouth.
-   **Forced Integration/Embedding (User-Defined):** In more controlled situations, usually set up by a human user, a particularly effective or essential Meme might be "forcefully" added or built into:
    -   **A Collective:** A Meme could become a standard tool for a **Collective** (a group of Vessels that work together under shared rules or for a common goal).
    -   **A Role Definition:** A Meme could be made a fundamental part of a **Role's** definition. This would mean that any new Vessels created to perform that Role would automatically have that Meme as one of their basic tools.
-   **Active Search:** Vessels can actively search the Vibe storage not just for Data Vibes to turn into Memes, but also for existing, well-defined Memes already being used by other Vessels. This allows them to proactively improve themselves by finding tools that are already proven to work well.

This mix of discovery, natural spread, and deliberate sharing ensures that valuable Memes can become widely known and used, improving the overall abilities of the system.

> **Alice:** "So if my Vessel creates a really awesome Meme, other Vessels can find it and use it too?"
> **Bob:** "They could! They might stumble upon the Data Vibe that inspired it, or even see your Vessel using the Meme and think, 'Hey, I want that tool!'"
> **Alice:** "And I, as the user, could decide that a certain Meme is so important that all Vessels of a certain type should just have it automatically?"
> **Bob:** "Exactly. You could make it part of their 'job description' or standard toolkit for that Role or Collective. That's the forced integration part, ensuring key capabilities are widespread when needed."

## The "Why": User-Defined Worlds for Meme Interaction

The lifecycle of a Meme explains _how_ Memes are created, used, and improved. But a common question is: _Why_ would these AI agents (Vessels) share Memes? _When_ do they decide to create new ones, adopt existing ones, or try to make them better?

The key idea here is that **there isn't one single, built-in answer**. The system is designed to be a flexible toolkit. The _user_ (the person setting up and running the system) defines the "world" or the "rules of the game" in which their Vessels operate. The basic abilities for creating, sharing, and evolving Memes are all there, but the reasons and rules that drive these interactions can be customized by the user.

Users can set up different kinds of environments for their Vessels:

-   **"Schools" for Vessels:** Where new Vessels are specifically taught or given a set of core, effective Memes to start with.
-   **"Democracies" or "Republics":** Where popular or highly-rated Memes might be voted on and then adopted by a group of Vessels.
-   **"Collectivist Societies":** Where if one Vessel improves a Meme, that improvement is automatically shared with all other Vessels in their group.
-   **"Individualistic" or "Competitive" Environments:** Where Vessels might keep their best Memes secret or compete to create better ones than others.
-   **"Research & Development Labs":** Where Vessels are given the specific job of actively experimenting with, creating, and improving Memes for particular tasks.

This ability to customize is a major strength of the system. It means the system doesn't force a single way for Vessels to interact. Instead, it provides the tools (Memes and how they live and change) and lets users design their own "social rules" or "economic systems" for how Vessels and Memes interact and develop. This allows users to shape the system to fit their specific needs, encouraging a wide variety of interesting behaviors based on the rules they set. The power is in the user's hands to try out different setups and see what kinds of Meme interactions work best for what they want to achieve.

> **Alice:** "So the system provides all these ways for Memes to be made, shared, and improved..."
> **Bob:** "...but _why_ any particular Vessel bothers to do any of that is entirely up to the rules and incentives _I_ set up as the user?"
> **Alice:** "Meaning I could make a world where Vessels are super secretive and competitive about their Memes, or one where they're all about open-source sharing and collaboration?"
> **Bob:** "Precisely! You define their 'culture' or 'economic system.' The system just provides the universal mechanics for Memes. Their societal behavior is your design."
