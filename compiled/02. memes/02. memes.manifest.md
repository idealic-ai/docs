The term "Meme" is used for its original, academic meaning: a unit of
cultural information that replicates, spreads, and evolves. This aligns with
system Memes as shareable, adaptable tool definitions (ideas/behaviors) that
propagate and are refined within the AI ecosystem, akin to cultural transmission.

JSON Schema acts as a blueprint for data, defining its expected structure,
rules, types, and constraints, much like the design for a fillable form.
It ensures predictability when LLMs or processes use Memes (which are JSON
Schemas) by guiding them to provide necessary information correctly.


---

Memes are tools defined by JSON Schemas, detailing their function, parameters,
and output structure. When an LLM uses a Meme, it populates this schema,
creating a structured JSON specification. This specification is a request
for an action, which the system then executes based on the provided details.


---

Memes originate when a Vessel locally adopts a Data Vibe (input, schema,
solution). The Vibe's schema becomes the Meme's JSON Schema tool definition;
its input/solution provide a usage example. This is a local Vessel act.
Vessels can also create more nuanced Memes by observing multiple Data Vibes
that share the same schema but showcase different successful input/solution pairs.


---

Memes are activated directly by an LLM based on context, or via composition
with other Memes. Helper/gating Memes add conditional logic, while trigger
Memes enable scheduled/event-based activation. This compositional use of
JSON Schema-defined tools allows for sophisticated, LLM-driven behaviors.


---

Memes integrate metrics via '$'-prefixed fields in their JSON schema.
When a Meme is used, an LLM can populate these fields with both quantitative
data and qualitative, AI-generated insights (e.g., sentiment analysis,
complexity assessment). This rich data is automatically persisted, directly
informing the Meme's evaluation stage.


---

Memes evolve through iterative refinement driven by metrics and AI feedback.
This creates new versions with updated schemas, examples, or instructions,
leveraging Vibe versioning. Crucially, gathered metrics can also be fed
back as input to the Meme itself, enabling it to consider past performance
for its next activation, fostering localized, autonomous adaptation.


---

Memes propagate via discovery (Vessels browsing Vibe storage or observing
other Vessels) and organic spread due to recognized utility. Users can also
forcefully integrate Memes into Hierarchies or Role definitions. Vessels
can actively search for useful Data Vibes or existing Memes, ensuring
valuable tools become widely available.


---

The motivations for Vessel interactions with Memes (sharing, creation,
refinement) are not hardcoded. Instead, users define the "world" or
operational paradigm (e.g., collaborative, competitive, educational) in
which their Vessels operate. This allows users to configure the "social
physics" governing Meme interactions, tailoring system behavior to their goals.
