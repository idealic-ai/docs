Conceptual Vibe patterns (like DNA blueprints, some system-provided) are the basis for Vibes.
They are not active objects. When a pattern's `schema` definition (its specific "DNA" at a point in time,
held within a Vibe's `schema` field) interacts with an `input`, it manifests a Vibe—an
immutable "footprint" or evidentiary record of that interaction. For Record Vibes, this
`schema` definition (e.g., JSON Schema) is directly in their `schema` field.
We understand these patterns by examining these Vibes, which contain the `input`,
`schema` definition used, and `solution`. When multiple Record Vibes are of the "same type,"
their `schema` fields contain identical definitions. This content-centric model allows
definitions to evolve for future interactions (typically towards more specific schemas)
without altering past evidentiary Vibes, ensuring history is preserved while enabling flexibility.

Content-first architecture inverts traditional design - instead of entities that
determine content, only the content (as part of a Vibe: {input, `schema` field, solution})
exists as the primary record, and the origin of `schema` definitions (e.g. system templates,
evolved definitions) is understood conceptually. This de-emphasizes abstract objects and
makes their interaction records (Vibes) primary, creating much greater flexibility.

Key advantages over traditional object-identity systems stem from this content-first
approach: Recorded `inputs` and `schema` definitions (from a Vibe's `schema` field)
can be re-processed to determine new `solutions` with different agents or evolved `schema`
definitions, enabling powerful experimentation and the modification of behavioral patterns
that lead to new `solutions` (a flexibility often lost with traditional abstract objects).
Interaction histories (Vibes) can be forked without complex object relationship management.
Content lineage tracking (via Vibes) replaces traditional entity state management, multiple
Vibe versions (different `solutions`) can coexist, and rollbacks access specific points in
Vibe history rather than restoring complex system states.

Conceptual patterns for `schema` definitions exist, but interaction happens by continuing
to "vibe" with existing content. If an article (a `solution` within a Vibe) was
determined, its original Vibe can be interacted with to change the article structure
(determine a new `solution` conforming to a potentially modified `schema` definition,
which would be stored in the new Vibe's `schema` field), transform the article into an
agent tool, or modify its underlying `input` or `schema` definition (leading to
a new Vibe with a new `solution`). This continuous interaction with any historical Vibe
directly enables the transformation of older `solutions` by determining new, modified
Vibes.

This enables temporal continuity: continuous 'vibing' (which includes **the
transformation of older `solutions` by determining new, modified `solutions` from
original Vibes**) means each Vibe preserves the complete context (`input`, `schema`
definition from its `schema` field) and the specific `solution` from its moment of
determination. Consequently, past interaction outcomes remain accessible through their
historical Vibes, allowing you to interact with any previous state of the system as if at
the time of original determination. Modification happens by creating alternative Vibes
(e.g., different `solutions` or `solutions` from evolved, typically more specific,
`schema` definitions), preserving originals.

Identity of conceptual patterns becomes secondary; the interaction pattern recorded in each Vibe
(`input` -> `schema` definition -> `solution`) is paramount. Versioning tracks content lineage.

The system features several primary Vibe Types, distinguished by their `schema` definition's
method of tool activation or structural definition for determining a `solution`:
(1) Role Vibes utilize concurrent tool activation for compositional effects in their `solutions`.
(2) Process Vibes orchestrate tools in deterministic sequential workflows to arrive at a `solution`.
(3) Record Vibes have `schema` definitions for structured data `solutions` that can embed tools for self-description and interaction.
(4) Capability Vibes have `schema` definitions that represent grants of authority.
These patterns create a comprehensive computational model for determining various kinds of `solutions`.

Vibes generated by a Vessel embodying a Role `schema` definition are characterized by their dynamic
and compositional nature. Multiple tools (memes) within the Role's `schema`
can trigger simultaneously in response to an `input`, not blocking the main
`solution` process. This concurrency enables emergent, compositional behaviors.

This capability-oriented model means Roles, by orchestrating different toolsets
(memes like reasoning frameworks, domain expertise, communication protocols,
value systems, behavioral styles, quality checks), define various Vessel types.
These Vessels can perform diverse functions, forming an organizational structure
where information and decisions flow naturally. This versatility allows Vessels
to operate across different time scales and manage varied work types based on
their Role's specific tool configuration.

Process Vibes (instantiated as Workflow Runs) implement a workflow-oriented
computational model focused on determinism and predictability in `solution` finding.
Their `schema` definitions specify a directed acyclic graph of sequential steps (tool invocations or
code) with explicit dependencies, enabling reliable transformation pipelines to determine
a `solution`. These `schema` definitions also emphasize strong input/output typing, explicit error
handling mechanisms, and built-in observability. Each step can be programmatic
code, an LLM function, or hybrid, bridging traditional computing and LLM capabilities.
Process Vibes excel at reducing entropy by replacing creative uncertainty with structured
workflows for determining their `solutions`, while maintaining flexibility to incorporate LLM
reasoning where beneficial. They embody the system's ability to dial determinism in
`solution` determination.


---

Record Vibes, instances of the Record Type, are inherently self-describing and interactive.
Their `schema` field contains a `schema` definition (e.g., a JSON Schema) that not only
describes the valid content structure for the `solution` (which *is* the data itself)
but may also include or imply associated tools that understand how to operate on that `solution`.
Some of these tools function like methods, representing actions that can be invoked on the
`solution` post-determination. Furthermore, the `schema` definition may describe
self-activating **trackers**—specialized tools that monitor interactions with the
Record `solution` after it has been determined, such as when it is viewed or used.


---

Capability Vibes (instantiated as Capability) define grants of
authority. Their `schema` field contains the actual permits specifying allowed
operations (what actions, on what targets, with what instructions, **and optionally, under what actor conditions**). Their `solution`
holds metadata about the grant (issuer, recipient, etc.). The system evaluates this
`schema` when a Capability is presented, to authorize or deny an operation based on **all specified conditions**,
rather than executing it to produce data. This underpins secure, auditable
permission management and delegation.


---

The four main Vibe Types (Role, Process, Record, Capability) have `schema` definitions in their `schema` fields that guide interactions, but the resulting **Vibes** all share fundamental properties:
- **Common Structure**: All use the {input, `schema` field, solution} pattern. The `schema` field contains the `schema` definition.
- **Immutability**: The entire {input, `schema` field, solution} triplet is immutable once created.
- **Self-containment**: Each Vibe has all it needs for its `solution` to be understood and its conformance to its `schema` definition reproduced (or all information to reconstruct this context).
- **Direct Addressability**: Any Vibe (and its `solution`) can be a point of interaction.
- **Content-First Orientation**: The Vibe's `solution` content is primary, rather than abstract processes (for Capability instances, the `schema` definition *is* the power, and the `solution` is metadata).
- **Optimistic Execution**: Vibes with initial `solutions` are determined readily.
- **Selective Refinement**: Improvements or variations on any Vibe are made by creating new Vibes with new or refined `solutions` (and potentially refined, more specific `schema` definitions in their `schema` field), allowing changes to be targeted without altering the original. This applies to any Vibe regardless of its class or complexity (for Capability instances, this is how delegation creates more specific capabilities by creating new Capability instances with more specific `schema` definitions).
- **Distinct Type Mechanisms**: While Vibes share these properties, their class-based patterns (Role, Process, Record, Capability) utilize distinct underlying mechanisms and tool orchestration/evaluation patterns based on their `schema` definitions to determine these Vibes, as detailed in their respective sections.

This architectural unity ensures consistent handling and compositional flexibility across the system.
