The wrapper can interleave its own steps (e.g., for planning, analysis, or evaluation) with the steps of the wrapped Instruction.

The Vessel says, &#39;I want to \u003ccode>LaunchProcess\u003c\\/code> for \u003ccode>BillingReport\u003c\\/code>.&#39; The system then looks up the \u003ccode>BillingReportProcess\u003c\\/code>, finds its specific starting instructions, and hands that &#39;customized&#39; start button back to the Vessel&#39;s LLM to fill out. The Vessel stays clean and simple, while the complex machinery is handled by the Process.&quot;\u003c\\/p>\n\u003c\\/blockquote>\n\u003ch3>Focused Context Management via \u003ccode>references\u003c\\/code>\u003c\\/h3>\n\u003cp>To maintain efficiency and stay within LLM context\\/schema limits, the workflow engine does not send the entire process history to the LLM for every step.

This property holds an array of strings, with each string being a path to a specific output from a previous step that the current step needs (e.g., \u003ccode>[&quot;step1_define_rules&quot;, &quot;step4_find_user.output&quot;]\u003c\\/code>).

It&#39;s like asking a colleague for help. You don&#39;t retell them the entire history of the project; you just say, &#39;Here&#39;s the customer&#39;s email from yesterday, can you draft a reply?&#39; It keeps the conversation focused and efficient.&quot;\u003c\\/p>\n\u003c\\/blockquote>\n\u003ch3>The Anatomy of a Compiled \u003ccode>Process\u003c\\/code> Vibe\u003c\\/h3>\n\u003cp>To make a \u003ccode>Process\u003c\\/code> self-contained and executable, the results of the compilation and partitioning are stored directly within the \u003ccode>Process\u003c\\/code> Vibe&#39;s own \u003ccode>schema\u003c\\/code>.\u003c\\/p>\n\u003cp>The \u003ccode>schema\u003c\\/code> of a \u003ccode>Process\u003c\\/code> Vibe contains a standard JSON Schema \u003ccode>$defs\u003c\\/code> block.

When the \u003ccode>LaunchProcess\u003c\\/code> macro is used, it dynamically reads the target \u003ccode>Process\u003c\\/code> Vibe&#39;s schema, finds the first \u003ccode>LLM_\u003c\\/code> definition, and presents that as the tool for the \u003ccode>Vessel\u003c\\/code> to execute. This makes every \u003ccode>Process\u003c\\/code> a self-describing, launchable entity.\u003c\\/p>\n\u003ch3>Advanced Process Capabilities: Batching and Multiplexing\u003c\\/h3>\n\u003cp>A \u003ccode>Process\u003c\\/code> is designed to operate on asynchronous streams of data, not just single instances. When a process needs to handle multiple items at once (multiplexing), it does so within a single context switch.\u003c\\/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Schema-Level Multiplexing\u003c\\/strong>: The compiled pipeline is a single, flat JSON object where each step is a property, multiplied by the batch size. To manage schema complexity limits and make the structure predictable for the LLM, we avoid nested arrays for batches. Instead, each item in a batch for each step becomes a distinct property. For example, a pipeline with \u003cstrong>4 steps\u003c\\/strong> processing a batch of \u003cstrong>3 items\u003c\\/strong> would be compiled into a single flat object with \u003cstrong>12 top-level properties\u003c\\/strong> (e.g., \u003ccode>step1_item1\u003c\\/code>, \u003ccode>step1_item2\u003c\\/code>, \u003ccode>step1_item3\u003c\\/code>, \u003ccode>step2_item1\u003c\\/code>, etc.). This allows the LLM to process the entire batch of work as a single, large object, which is highly efficient.\u003c\\/p>\n\u003c\\/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Native Async Iteration\u003c\\/strong>: On the server, the compiled process pipeline maps directly onto an asynchronous iterator, leveraging our \u003ccode>@augceo\\/iterators\u003c\\/code> library. This allows for highly efficient, concurrent processing of both LLM-based and programmatic steps, with built-in support for back-pressure and resource management. This minimizes context switches on the server as well, allowing multiple programmatic steps to execute before needing to call an LLM again.\u003c\\/p>\n\u003c\\/li>\n\u003c\\/ul>\n","currentChapter":"New Ideas in This Chapter"}}</script>
