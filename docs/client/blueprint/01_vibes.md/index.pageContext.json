It represents an immutable, self-contained record of a specific interaction where a <code>solution</code> is determined based on a <code>context</code> and a guiding <code>schema</code> definition. Each Vibe encapsulates:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>context</strong>: The contextual information and parameters (e.g., a user prompt, data, memory) that define the specifics for a given interaction.</li>\n<li><strong>schema</strong>: This field within a Vibe directly contains its complete structural blueprint, which is a JSON Schema object. This <code>schema</code> definition guides the determination of the <code>solution</code> and may also imply or reference operational patterns or embedded tools. Conceptually, it can be likened to an &quot;equation&quot; or a set of criteria that the <code>solution</code> must satisfy. For Record Vibes, this field explicitly holds the JSON Schema defining the structure of its <code>solution</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>solution</strong>: The resulting content or outcome. The system, or an external agent like an LLM, <em>determines</em> or <em>finds</em> a <code>solution</code> that <em>conforms</em> to the <code>schema</code> definition (found in the Vibe&#39;s <code>schema</code> field) given the specific <code>context</code>. The success, nature, and even the specific value of this <code>solution</code> can depend on the capabilities of the agent involved in its determination.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This {context, <code>schema</code> field, solution} triplet forms an <strong>immutable</strong> and <strong>self-contained</strong> record.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Immutability</strong>: A specific Vibe, once recorded with its determined <code>solution</code>, is fixed. If a different <code>solution</code> is needed for the same <code>context</code> and <code>schema</code> definition, a new Vibe is created. This core principle is vital for system integrity and offers several advantages: it enables reliable versioning and the safe reuse of <code>solutions</code>, prevents version conflicts in collaborative work, provides a stable foundation for composing complex interactions from known quantities, and allows for robust historical analysis and debugging.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-containment</strong>: A Vibe functions as a complete and independent unit. This is because it <strong>either directly includes all necessary components</strong> (its <code>context</code>, the specific <code>schema</code> definition it adhered to (within its <code>schema</code> field), and the determined <code>solution</code>) <strong>or contains all information required to reconstruct this complete context</strong>. Consequently, a Vibe&#39;s recorded outcome is stable and its conformance to its <code>schema</code> definition is verifiable. The Vibe consistently represents the interaction&#39;s understanding, independent of any specific environment, and will produce the same conceptual outcome for its <code>schema(context)</code> wherever it is processed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While individual Vibes are persistently stored, the <code>schema</code> definitions (the conceptual &quot;equation forms&quot; or structural blueprints) originate from system-provided templates or are derived and evolved from predecessor Vibes. From any Vibe, one can always inspect the <code>schema</code> definition it conformed to (within its <code>schema</code> field) and the <code>context</code> it processed.</p>\n<p>This approach means that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To arrive at a <em>different or refined <code>solution</code></em> for the same <code>schema</code> definition and <code>context</code>, a new Vibe is created.</li>\n<li>When a <code>schema</code> definition is <em>modified</em>, signifying an evolution or refinement:<ul>\n<li>New Vibes adopt this updated <code>schema</code> definition in their <code>schema</code> field. This can lead to different, often more precise, <code>solutions</code>.</li>\n<li>This modification represents a <em>refinement</em> of the Vibe&#39;s conceptual type. It&#39;s an <em>extension</em> and <em>refinement</em> of the original <code>schema</code> definition, making it more specific by adding detail or constraints. This ensures the Vibe evolves coherently, maintaining its fundamental nature rather than becoming a completely unrelated type whose <code>schema</code> definition would no longer satisfy the original&#39;s core principles. (The mechanics of such transformations are detailed later.)</li>\n<li>Because this is a refining extension, any <code>solution</code> that conforms to the new, more specific <code>schema</code> definition will also inherently satisfy the original, more general <code>schema</code> definition from which it evolved.</li>\n<li>Importantly, existing Vibes always keep their original <code>schema</code> definition from when they were made, ensuring past records stay intact.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To process <em>different <code>context</code></em> with the same <code>schema</code> definition, a new Vibe is created, capturing the specific <code>solution</code> for that instance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach offers several key architectural advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content-Centricity</strong>: Our focus is always on the Vibes themselves—the concrete evidence of interactions and their <code>solutions</code>—rather than on abstract, conceptual patterns that provide the <code>schema</code> definitions**. This inverts traditional object-oriented programming, which often stores internal object states while hiding the messaging. By making the records of interaction (Vibes) primary and persistent, the system becomes much easier to work with and migrate.</li>\n<li><strong>Identity Flexibility</strong>: Conceptual Vibe patterns can evolve. Their defining <code>schema</code> definitions (their &quot;DNA&quot;) can be updated or refined over time, usually towards greater specificity. This evolution means that new Vibes, while incorporating these more detailed and specific <code>schema</code> definitions, can still be understood as conforming to the original, broader conceptual pattern they evolved from. Such changes towards specificity affect only <em>future</em> Vibes created with the new <code>schema</code> definition version (often through transformative operations on existing Vibes). Existing Vibes, as immutable historical records, remain unchanged, preserving the integrity of past interactions. This allows for flexible evolution without breaking historical context, as even specialized Vibes can retain their conceptual lineage to the general pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Portability &amp; Reproducibility</strong>: Because each Vibe is a self-contained piece of evidence, holding its complete context (<code>context</code>, <code>schema</code> definition used from its <code>schema</code> field, <code>solution</code>) it can be understood, analyzed, and its <code>solution</code> verified independently of any specific environment or the state of its originating conceptual pattern at a later time.</li>\n<li><strong>Efficient Storage</strong>: We only need to store the Vibes—the tangible &quot;footprints&quot; of interactions. There&#39;s no need to maintain and store a persistent, active instance for every potential or actual conceptual pattern.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This perspective helps resolve paradoxes related to identity and change over time. Like DNA, a Vibe is a fixed record of a specific moment. Even if the &quot;source organism&quot; (the conceptual pattern) evolves, the DNA sample (the Vibe) remains a faithful record of what it was. This provides a robust foundation for versioning, historical analysis, and understanding change within the system.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-llm\">Conceptual Vibe patterns (like DNA blueprints, some system-provided) are the basis for Vibes.\nThey are not active objects. When a pattern&#39;s `schema` definition (its specific &quot;DNA&quot; at a point in time,\nheld within a Vibe&#39;s `schema` field) interacts with a `context`, it manifests a Vibe—an\nimmutable &quot;footprint&quot; or evidentiary record of that interaction. For Record Vibes, this\n`schema` definition (e.g., JSON Schema) is directly in their `schema` field.\nWe understand these patterns by examining these Vibes, which contain the `context`,\n`schema` definition used, and `solution`. When multiple Record Vibes are of the &quot;same type,&quot;\ntheir `schema` fields contain identical definitions. This content-centric model allows\ndefinitions to evolve for future interactions (typically towards more specific schemas)\nwithout altering past evidentiary Vibes, ensuring history is preserved while enabling flexibility.\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;So we never actually see these conceptual patterns like &#39;Roles&#39; or &#39;Record Schemas&#39; directly as active agents?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;Right—only the Vibes they help determine, which are like their &#39;footprints&#39; or &#39;DNA samples&#39;. Each Vibe is a concrete record showing the specific <code>schema</code> definition—the pattern&#39;s &#39;DNA&#39; at that moment, stored in the Vibe&#39;s own <code>schema</code> field—that was used with a <code>context</code> to get a <code>solution</code>.&quot;\n<strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;And we infer the nature of the pattern, or its &#39;DNA profile&#39; at the time, by studying these Vibe &#39;samples&#39;? If I have ten &#39;Invoice&#39; Record Vibes, they all have the same invoice JSON schema in their <code>schema</code> field?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;Exactly—the Vibes are the evidence. And yes, those ten Invoice Record Vibes would share an identical JSON schema in their <code>schema</code> fields. If the conceptual pattern for an &#39;Invoice&#39; evolves its &#39;DNA&#39; later—say, to add a new required field—that only affects new &#39;Invoice&#39; Vibes created from that point, typically by transforming an older one. The old ones remain unchanged records of past activity.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code class=\"language-question\">How do we understand conceptual Vibe patterns if they are not active objects in the system?\n* [x] By examining Vibes, which act as &quot;DNA samples&quot; or &quot;footprints,&quot; providing all necessary information (`context`, `schema` definition used from the Vibe&#39;s `schema` field, `solution`) from a specific interaction.\n* [x] We infer the characteristics of a conceptual pattern (as it was at a point in time) from the collection of Vibes it has manifested. For Record Vibes, the `schema` definition (e.g., JSON Schema) is directly within each Vibe&#39;s `schema` field.\n* [x] Although conceptual Vibe pattern definitions (&quot;DNA&quot;) can evolve for future interactions (usually towards greater specificity), existing Vibes remain immutable records of past activities with specific `schema` definition versions.\n* [ ] Conceptual patterns maintain a persistent, active state in the system that we can query directly.\n* [ ] Each Vibe contains only a partial &quot;genetic marker&quot; of its conceptual pattern, requiring many Vibes to reconstruct a single `schema` definition.\n* [ ] The &quot;footprints&quot; (Vibes) change retroactively if the conceptual pattern&#39;s &quot;DNA&quot; evolves.\n* [ ] We primarily understand conceptual patterns by their abstract definitions, with Vibes being secondary, illustrative examples.\n* [ ] The system clones an active conceptual pattern from its &quot;DNA&quot; (Vibe) each time we need to interact with it.\n* [ ] All potential conceptual patterns in the &quot;vast universe&quot; are constantly active and leaving &quot;footprints.&quot;\n* [ ] Vibes are like &quot;potential DNA&quot; that only becomes a complete record if the conceptual pattern is explicitly instantiated as an object.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Content-First Architecture</h2>\n<p>The system operates on a fundamental principle: <strong>we study the communication and the determined outcomes (Vibes, which include the <code>context</code>, <code>schema</code> field with its definition, and <code>solution</code>) rather than focusing on abstract entities or patterns that provide the <code>schema</code> definitions</strong>. This inverts traditional object-oriented programming, which often stores internal object states while hiding the messaging. By making the records of interaction (Vibes) primary and persistent, the system becomes much easier to work with and migrate.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Content teaches creation</strong> — By encountering example content, systems learn to create more of that type.</li>\n<li><strong>Functions arise from data</strong> — The <code>schema</code> definition of existing content can become the template for functions that generate similar content.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimistic execution</strong> — Content is generated immediately and can be refined or branched later by creating new Vibes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This approach provides several critical advantages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>No complex identity management for conceptual patterns</strong> — Sidestepping complex identity maintenance for the conceptual patterns simplifies branching, versioning, and forking interaction histories (recorded as Vibes).</li>\n<li><strong>Content tells the story</strong> — Each Vibe contains everything needed to understand what <code>context</code> was processed, what <code>schema</code> definition (from its <code>schema</code> field) guided the interaction, and what <code>solution</code> was determined.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible reconstruction of conceptual pattern understanding</strong> — The nature of a <code>schema</code> definition can be inferred or reconstructed by examining examples of Vibes determined under its guidance.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy rollback</strong> — Environments can be restored by simply changing which Vibes are active, effectively accessing specific points in interaction history.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Experimentation &amp; Replay</strong> — Recorded <code>contexts</code> and <code>schema</code> definitions from Vibes can be re-processed (e.g., by different agents or with modified <code>schema</code> definitions from evolved conceptual patterns) to determine new <code>solutions</code>. This allows for powerful what-if scenarios and testing, a flexibility often lost when state is hidden within the less inspectable traditional abstract objects.</li>\n<li><strong>Coexistence of Versions</strong> — Multiple Vibe versions (e.g., different <code>solutions</code> to the same <code>context</code>+<code>schema</code> definition, or <code>solutions</code> based on evolved <code>schema</code> definitions, which are typically more specific) can coexist simultaneously, with clear content lineage, replacing complex state management of traditional objects.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This approach yields significant benefits. Because conceptual Vibe patterns don&#39;t require complex identity management, operations like branching, versioning, and forking interaction histories (which are simply recorded series of Vibes) become much simpler. Each Vibe inherently tells its own story, containing the <code>context</code>, the guiding <code>schema</code> definition (from its <code>schema</code> field), and the resulting <code>solution</code>. This self-contained nature also allows the underlying characteristics of a conceptual pattern&#39;s <code>schema</code> definition to be flexibly inferred or reconstructed by examining the Vibes it has produced.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, system state management is greatly simplified: environments can be rolled back by changing which Vibes are considered active, providing direct access to specific points in the interaction history. The content-first model promotes robust experimentation and replay, as recorded <code>contexts</code> and <code>schema</code> definitions from existing Vibes can be re-processed—perhaps by different agents or with evolved <code>schema</code> definitions from updated conceptual patterns—to explore alternative <code>solutions</code> and conduct powerful what-if analyses. This is a level of flexibility often missing when critical state is hidden within less inspectable traditional objects. Finally, this architecture naturally supports the coexistence of multiple Vibe versions (such as different <code>solutions</code> for the same <code>context</code> and <code>schema</code> definition, or <code>solutions</code> derived from evolved, more specific <code>schema</code> definitions), all while maintaining clear content lineage and avoiding the complexities of traditional state management.</p>\n<p>The system enables direct conversation with any Vibe itself. Rather than instructing an abstract entity to &quot;rewrite this article,&quot; you can address the Vibe containing the article (a specific <code>solution</code>) directly: &quot;Could you determine a <code>solution</code> that is a version of yourself with a more technical tone?&quot; The system then facilitates the determination of a new Vibe (a new <code>solution</code>) that builds upon the original—preserving its immutable nature—effectively allowing transformation of old content by interacting with its original Vibe. This means multiple Vibe versions can coexist, and a clear content lineage is maintained.</p>\n<p>This also enables controlled propagation of changes—you can determine which downstream Vibes need re-determination when swapping versions of a Vibe. The lineage between Vibes is preserved while maintaining individual Vibe integrity.</p>\n<p>Temporal continuity emerges because each Vibe preserves the complete context (<code>context</code> and <code>schema</code> definition from its <code>schema</code> field) and the determined <code>solution</code> from its moment of determination. This continuous &#39;vibing&#39; — which includes <strong>transforming older <code>solutions</code> by interacting with their original Vibe to determine new, modified <code>solutions</code></strong> — makes past interaction outcomes readily accessible through their historical Vibes, allowing ongoing conversations and interactions with them as if happening at the time of original determination; the full fidelity of that moment is preserved. This makes time-travel a genuine system capability. With the identity of conceptual patterns de-emphasized, what matters is the interaction pattern (<code>context</code> -&gt; <code>schema</code> definition -&gt; <code>solution</code>) recorded within each Vibe.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-llm\">Content-first architecture inverts traditional design - instead of entities that\ndetermine content, only the content (as part of a Vibe: {context, `schema` field, solution})\nexists as the primary record, and the origin of `schema` definitions (e.g. system templates,\nevolved definitions) is understood conceptually. This de-emphasizes abstract objects and\nmakes their interaction records (Vibes) primary, creating much greater flexibility.\n\nKey advantages over traditional object-identity systems stem from this content-first\napproach: Recorded `contexts` and `schema` definitions (from a Vibe&#39;s `schema` field)\ncan be re-processed to determine new `solutions` with different agents or evolved `schema`\ndefinitions, enabling powerful experimentation and the modification of behavioral patterns\nthat lead to new `solutions` (a flexibility often lost with traditional abstract objects).\nInteraction histories (Vibes) can be forked without complex object relationship management.\nContent lineage tracking (via Vibes) replaces traditional entity state management, multiple\nVibe versions (different `solutions`) can coexist, and rollbacks access specific points in\nVibe history rather than restoring complex system states.\n\nConceptual patterns for `schema` definitions exist, but interaction happens by continuing\nto &quot;vibe&quot; with existing content. If an article (a `solution` within a Vibe) was\ndetermined, its original Vibe can be interacted with to change the article structure\n(determine a new `solution` conforming to a potentially modified `schema` definition,\nwhich would be stored in the new Vibe&#39;s `schema` field), transform the article into an\nagent tool, or modify its underlying `context` or `schema` definition (leading to\na new Vibe with a new `solution`). This continuous interaction with any historical Vibe\ndirectly enables the transformation of older `solutions` by determining new, modified\nVibes.\n\nThis enables temporal continuity: continuous &#39;vibing&#39; (which includes **the\ntransformation of older `solutions` by determining new, modified `solutions` from\noriginal Vibes**) means each Vibe preserves the complete context (`context`, `schema`\ndefinition from its `schema` field) and the specific `solution` from its moment of\ndetermination. Consequently, past interaction outcomes remain accessible through their\nhistorical Vibes, allowing you to interact with any previous state of the system as if at\nthe time of original determination. Modification happens by creating alternative Vibes\n(e.g., different `solutions` or `solutions` from evolved, typically more specific,\n`schema` definitions), preserving originals.\n\nIdentity of conceptual patterns becomes secondary; the interaction pattern recorded in each Vibe\n(`context` -&gt; `schema` definition -&gt; `solution`) is paramount. Versioning tracks content lineage.\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;So I can talk directly to any Vibe&#39;s <code>solution</code>, not just some abstract pattern that defined its <code>schema</code> definition?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;Exactly—you can address the article Vibe itself and ask it to determine a new version (a new <code>solution</code>) with a different tone.&quot;\n<strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;But we don&#39;t modify the original Vibe, right?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;Correct—we determine new Vibes (new <code>solutions</code>) based on the original while preserving its immutable nature.

We call these tools <a href=\"#memes\"><strong>memes</strong></a> because they act as self-propagating units of functionality, akin to social memes. Each such tool represents a specific capability, from reasoning and analysis to communication and process management.</p>\n<p>The primary distinction between the main <strong>Vibe Types</strong> (conceptual categories of Vibes based on their <code>schema</code> definition&#39;s nature) lies in how their inherent <code>schema</code> definitions activate and orchestrate these tools (or define structure) to determine a conforming <code>solution</code> based on a <code>context</code>. This distinction is made to enable the system to effectively model a wide range of computational patterns. A Vibe&#39;s <code>schema</code> field contains the <code>schema</code> definition that guides an interaction.

An instance of such a Vibe is called a <strong>Vessel</strong> (e.g., a specific bot). The <code>solutions</code> determined by a Vessel embodying a Role <code>schema</code> definition exhibit these characteristics:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-llm\">Vibes generated by a Vessel embodying a Role `schema` definition are characterized by their dynamic\nand compositional nature. Multiple tools (memes) within the Role&#39;s `schema`\ncan trigger simultaneously in response to a `context`, not blocking the main\n`solution` process. This concurrency enables emergent, compositional behaviors.\n\nThis capability-oriented model means Roles, by orchestrating different toolsets\n(memes like reasoning frameworks, domain expertise, communication protocols,\nvalue systems, behavioral styles, quality checks), define various Vessel types.\nThese Vessels can perform diverse functions, forming an organizational structure\nwhere information and decisions flow naturally. This versatility allows Vessels\nto operate across different time scales and manage varied work types based on\ntheir Role&#39;s specific tool configuration.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each tool represents a distinct capability. Role <code>schema</code> definitions can be configured with different collections of tools, defining various types of Vessels and, consequently, different patterns for <code>solution</code> determination, enabling them to perform diverse functions within the system. These capabilities, actualized by tools, span areas such as reasoning frameworks (like analysis approaches or problem-solving strategies), domain expertise (including specialized skills and knowledge bases), communication protocols, value systems, behavioral styles, and quality checks.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-question\">Which of the following characteristics are true of Vibes generated from Role `schema` definitions (instantiated as Vessels)?\n* [x] Tools can fire simultaneously without blocking the main `solution` determination\n* [x] Earlier tool activations can affect downstream behavior in determining the `solution`\n* [x] Concurrency among tools enables emergent compositional `solutions` (behaviors)\n* [ ] Vibes from Roles rely on a single linear execution thread for their `solution`\n* [ ] Tool activation always blocks until everything finishes before a `solution` is found\n* [ ] Vibes from Roles are limited to determining data-validation `solutions`\n* [ ] Vibes from Roles are limited to a single, predefined organizational role (A single Role `schema` definition defines one role, but there can be many different Roles for different types of Vibes)\n* [ ] The activation network prevents tools from interacting when determining a `solution`\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-question\">What are key outcomes or characteristics of the capability-based approach used by Role `schema` definitions for `solution` determination?\n* [x] Vessels (instances of Role Vibes) can be configured to perform diverse functions, from worker tasks to strategic decision-making, by combining different toolsets in their `schema` definition.\n* [x] It supports the creation of an organizational structure with natural information and decision flows based on the capabilities defined in Role `schema` definitions.\n* [x] Vessels can operate on different time scales and handle varied work types based on their Role&#39;s tool configurations.\n* [ ] Each Role is limited to a single, rigidly defined capability, such as only reasoning or only communication.\n* [ ] The capability-based approach means all Vessels are identical in function, regardless of their specific Role `schema` definition.\n* [ ] Tools within a Role `schema` definition are always activated in a strict, predefined sequence, never concurrently.\n* [ ] This approach eliminates the need for any `context` to a Vessel, as its capabilities are entirely self-contained.\n* [ ] Information primarily flows downwards in a Role-based hierarchy, with minimal upward reporting.\n* [ ] Roles are designed such that their `solutions` are always simple and atomic, never compositional.\n* [ ] The primary outcome is to ensure every Vibe produced by a Role is identical to Vibes from Process or Record Vibes.\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;So Vessels, as instances of Role Vibes, can activate multiple tools at once when determining a <code>solution</code>?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;Exactly—creating powerful compositional effects where different capabilities interact to form the <code>solution</code>.&quot;\n<strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;And these tools and the capabilities they represent define the Role <code>schema</code> definition, and thus the Vessel&#39;s function in determining specific kinds of <code>solutions</code>?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;Right—by combining different sets of tools in a Role&#39;s <code>schema</code> definition, we define types of Vessels like workers, supervisors, or executives, each aimed at determining different classes of <code>solutions</code>.&quot;\n<strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;So the same fundamental Vibe structure (a Vibe with a Role <code>schema</code> definition in its <code>schema</code> field) supports different functions based on the tools it&#39;s configured with, leading to varied Vibes?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;Precisely—it&#39;s a capability-based approach to creating an organizational structure through definable Roles actualized by Vessel instances, each determining Vibes according to its <code>schema</code> definition.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>(See <code>01_vibes_examples.md</code> for detailed examples of Role Vibes.)</em></p>\n<h3>Process Vibes: Sequential Deterministic Steps for Structured Solutions</h3>\n<p>A <strong>Process Vibe</strong> has a <code>schema</code> definition that specifies a sequential workflow of deterministic steps (which can be seen as specific tool invocations or programmatic logic) that transform <code>contexts</code> through a defined pipeline to arrive at a <code>solution</code>. This forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each step declares its dependencies. An instance of a Process Vibe is a <strong>Workflow Run</strong>. The <code>solutions</code> determined by a Workflow Run executing a Process <code>schema</code> definition exhibit these characteristics:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-llm\">Process Vibes (instantiated as Workflow Runs) implement a workflow-oriented\ncomputational model focused on determinism and predictability in `solution` finding.\nTheir `schema` definitions specify a directed acyclic graph of sequential steps (tool invocations or\ncode) with explicit dependencies, enabling reliable transformation pipelines to determine\na `solution`. These `schema` definitions also emphasize strong input/output typing, explicit error\nhandling mechanisms, and built-in observability. Each step can be programmatic\ncode, an LLM function, or hybrid, bridging traditional computing and LLM capabilities.\nProcess Vibes excel at reducing entropy by replacing creative uncertainty with structured\nworkflows for determining their `solutions`, while maintaining flexibility to incorporate LLM\nreasoning where beneficial. They embody the system&#39;s ability to dial determinism in\n`solution` determination.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Vibes resulting from Workflow Runs, which execute a Process <code>schema</code> definition, are well-suited for bridging creative LLM work with deterministic computing. They are designed for efficient operation on data streams and batches. The steps within these <code>schema</code> definitions are composable and can be reused across different Process <code>schema</code> definitions, building a library of operations. Furthermore, Process <code>schema</code> definitions incorporate explicit error handling for failures and edge cases, strong input/output typing to ensure correct data flow, and built-in observability through logging and monitoring of execution performance during <code>solution</code> determination.</p>\n<p>Process <code>schema</code> definitions are ideal for predictable workflows that require both reliability and flexibility when determining their <code>solutions</code>. Common use cases include data transformation pipelines, multi-stage content <code>solution</code> finding, or complex data processing flows that effectively combine LLM capabilities with traditional computing.

The <code>solution</code> of a Record Vibe <em>is</em> the structured content itself, conforming to this <code>schema</code> definition, given a specific <code>context</code>. For example, a particular invoice document is a Record Vibe whose <code>solution</code> is the structured invoice data, and its <code>schema</code> field contains the JSON Schema defining an invoice. The Vibes that represent this Record (as a <code>solution</code>) have the following characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Record Vibe&#39;s <code>schema</code> field describes the valid content structure for its <code>solution</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>schema</code> definition may also reference or imply associated tools that know how to operate on the Record <code>solution</code>. Some of these tools are like methods, representing potential actions that can be voluntarily invoked later on the <code>solution</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>schema</code> definition may also describe self-activating <strong>trackers</strong> (specialized tools) that monitor interactions with the Record <code>solution</code>. These trackers activate after the initial Record <code>solution</code> is determined.</li>\n<li>This effectively makes the resulting Record Vibe (containing the Record <code>solution</code> and its structural <code>schema</code> definition) self-describing and interactive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The activation pattern for a Record Vibe is that its <code>solution</code> (the structured content) is determined immediately based on its <code>schema</code> definition (from its <code>schema</code> field) and the given <code>context</code>. Trackers then activate based on their triggers (e.g., when the Record <code>solution</code> is viewed or used). Other embedded tools, which are more like methods, represent potential actions that can be invoked on the Record <code>solution</code> later.</p>\n<p>Record Vibes transform passive content into active resources through several mechanisms.\nThe <code>schema</code> definition in their <code>schema</code> field ensures the Record <code>solution</code> instance\nmaintains integrity via schema validation and follows defined patterns. The Record <code>solution</code>\npossesses contextual awareness, understanding its own purpose, origin, and relationship\nto other data, as guided by its <code>schema</code> definition. Operations (tools) that can be\nperformed on the Record <code>solution</code> instance are associated with it by its <code>schema</code> definition,\nwhich also provides embedded self-documentation regarding fields, constraints, and usage\npatterns. This allows Record <code>solution</code> instances to exhibit interactive behaviors,\nresponding to queries, being transformed, or triggering actions based on the tools and\ntrackers associated with their <code>schema</code> definition.</p>\n<p>Record tools, associated via the <code>schema</code> definition, include capabilities like format\nconversion, visualization, summarization, analysis, and integration for the Record <code>solutions</code>.\nUnlike traditional static data formats, Record Vibes carry both their structure (in the\n<code>schema</code> field) and their operational capabilities together.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#trackers\"><strong>Trackers</strong></a> are specialized tools associated with a Record Vibe&#39;s <code>schema</code>\ndefinition that activate automatically based on triggers, enabling the resulting Record\n<code>solution</code> to respond to being viewed or used. They create a distributed awareness\nsystem where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Record <code>solution</code> knows when it&#39;s being accessed and by whom</li>\n<li>Usage patterns can trigger notifications or adaptations</li>\n<li>Metrics can be collected without explicit reporting mechanisms</li>\n<li>The Record <code>solution</code> becomes an active participant in workflows rather than a passive resource</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;So Record Vibes have their <code>schema</code> definition, like a JSON Schema, right in their <code>schema</code> field, defining both structure and behavior for the Record <code>solutions</code> they contain?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;Right—the <code>schema</code> definition in the <code>schema</code> field makes the resulting Record <code>solution</code> self-describing and can include or imply built-in tools and trackers.&quot;\n<strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;And trackers make the Record <code>solution</code> almost alive, activating after it&#39;s determined?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;Exactly—it can respond to being viewed, adapt itself, and communicate back, based on its <code>schema</code> definition&#39;s specifications for the <code>solution</code>.&quot;\n<strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;So Record, as a <code>solution</code> instance from a Record Vibe, becomes an active participant rather than just information?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;Exactly! So Record Vibes aren&#39;t just defining static data; they&#39;re helping create Record <code>solutions</code> that are more like active capabilities, not just boring facts or figures, because their <code>schema</code> field packs so much in.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code class=\"language-question\">Regarding Record Vibes (Record Vibes), what is the role and activation characteristic of Trackers?\n* [x] Trackers are specialized tools associated with a Record Vibe&#39;s `schema` definition that activate automatically based on triggers *after* the initial Record `solution` is determined.\n* [x] They enable the Record `solution` to respond to being viewed or used, making it an active participant.\n* [x] Trackers contribute to a distributed awareness system by allowing Record `solutions` to monitor their own usage and potentially trigger adaptations or notifications.\n* [ ] Trackers are the primary tools that initially determine and structure the Record `solution` itself.\n* [ ] Trackers only activate once when the initial `schema` definition is first conceived, not in relation to individual Record `solution` instances.\n* [ ] The activation of Trackers requires explicit manual invocation by a user or another system component for each interaction.\n* [ ] Record `solutions` can have embedded tools or Trackers, but not both simultaneously. (They can have both)\n* [ ] Trackers are exclusively used for schema validation and ensuring data integrity, not for monitoring interactions.\n* [ ] The presence of Trackers makes the Record `solution` immutable and prevents any further operations on it.\n* [ ] Trackers are defined within Role Vibes and are delegated to Record Vibes for execution on Record `solutions`.\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Capability Vibes: Defining Authority and Resources</h3>\n<p>A <strong>Capability Vibe</strong> represents a unified grant of authority and resources. An instance of such a Vibe is a <strong>Capability</strong>. It&#39;s a powerful, versatile structure that serves as a permission slip, a wallet, a budget, and a task definition all in one.</p>\n<p>The <code>solution</code> of a Capability Vibe contains its core logic, which typically includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><code>provisions</code></strong>: An object defining the resources this capability holds or makes available, such as a monetary budget (e.g., <code>{ &quot;totalUsd&quot;: 50000 }</code>), API credits, or other digital assets. This is the &quot;wallet&quot; aspect.</li>\n<li><strong><code>permits</code></strong>: An array of permit objects, where each permit defines a specific <code>refine</code> operation the capability authorizes. This is the &quot;permission slip&quot; aspect. Each permit specifies:<ul>\n<li><code>targetSchema</code>: A schema for the <code>target</code> Vibe(s) of the <code>refine</code> call.</li>\n<li><code>instructionSchema</code>: A schema for the <code>instruction</code> Vibe(s).</li>\n<li><code>cost</code>: An object that links the authorized action to the <code>provisions</code>, defining how much of a resource is consumed when the permit is used.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This integrated structure means a Capability doesn&#39;t just say <em>what</em> you can do, but also provides the <em>means</em> to do it. The Capability&#39;s <code>schema</code> definition defines the valid structure for these <code>provisions</code> and <code>permits</code>.</p>\n<p>Instead of being executed to produce a data output, a Capability&#39;s <code>solution</code> is evaluated by the system when presented as authorization for a <code>refine</code> operation. The system checks if the <code>target</code> and <code>instruction</code> match a permit&#39;s schemas and if the <code>provisions</code> are sufficient to cover the <code>cost</code> of the action.</p>\n<p><strong>Delegation and Budgeting:</strong> Delegating authority or allocating a budget is done by <code>refine</code>&#39;ing a parent Capability. This creates a new, more specific Capability with restricted permits or a smaller portion of the original <code>provisions</code>. The original Capability is updated to reflect the allocated resources, creating a clear, auditable lineage of how authority and budgets are distributed.</p>\n<p>This unified approach is crucial for managing permissions, budgets, and tasks in a controlled, auditable, and decentralized way. Like all Vibes, Capabilities are immutable; changes to permissions or budgets result in new Capability Vibes.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-llm\">A Capability Vibe is a unified grant of authority and resources, acting as a\npermission slip, wallet, and budget in one. Its `solution` contains `provisions`\n(the resources it holds, like a budget) and an array of `permits`. Each permit\nauthorizes a specific `refine` operation by defining schemas for the `target`\nand `instruction`, and a `cost` that links the action to the `provisions`.\nThe system validates a Capability by checking permits and ensuring sufficient\nprovisions. Delegation and budgeting are handled by `refine`&#39;ing a parent\nCapability to create a new, more specific one, ensuring an auditable lineage.\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;So a single Capability is now a permission slip and a wallet combined? It says I can commission an article, <em>and</em> it holds the $500 to pay for it?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;Exactly. The <code>permits</code> array says what you can do, and the <code>provisions</code> object holds the budget. The <code>cost</code> field inside each permit connects the two, specifying which part of the budget that specific action can spend from.&quot;\n<strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;And if I want to give my colleague a $100 portion of that budget to commission a smaller blog post?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;You&#39;d <code>refine</code> your main Capability. That would create two new ones: one for your colleague with a $100 <code>provision</code> and a permit for blog posts, and an updated version of your own Capability, now showing a remaining budget of $400. It&#39;s all connected and traceable.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code class=\"language-question\">How does the unified Capability Vibe integrate permissions and resources?\n* [x] The `solution` contains both `provisions` (resources like a budget) and `permits` (authorized actions).\n* [x] Each permit contains a `cost` field that explicitly links the authorized action to a specific resource allocation within the `provisions`.\n* [x] Delegating a portion of a budget is done by `refine`&#39;ing a Capability, which creates a new Capability with a smaller provisioned amount.\n* [ ] The `provisions` are stored in a separate Resource Vibe that must be referenced.\n* [ ] A Capability can only define permissions or hold resources, but not both simultaneously.\n* [ ] The `cost` of an action is determined by the LLM at runtime, not defined in the permit.\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>(See <code>01_vibes_examples.md</code> for detailed examples of Capability Vibes.)</em></p>\n<h2>Unifying Principles</h2>\n<p>Despite the varied operational patterns of their classes (Role-like, Process-like, Record-like, and Capability-like), all <strong>Vibes</strong> themselves, as the fundamental units of interaction, share a set of core, unifying characteristics. These are:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-llm\">The four main Vibe Types (Role, Process, Record, Capability) have `schema` definitions in their `schema` fields that guide interactions, but the resulting **Vibes** all share fundamental properties:\n- **Common Structure**: All use the {context, `schema` field, solution} pattern. The `schema` field contains the `schema` definition.\n- **Immutability**: The entire {context, `schema` field, solution} triplet is immutable once created.\n- **Self-containment**: Each Vibe has all it needs for its `solution` to be understood and its conformance to its `schema` definition reproduced (or all information to reconstruct this context).\n- **Direct Addressability**: Any Vibe (and its `solution`) can be a point of interaction.\n- **Content-First Orientation**: The Vibe&#39;s `solution` content is primary, rather than abstract processes (for Capability instances, the `schema` definition *is* the power, and the `solution` is metadata).\n- **Optimistic Execution**: Vibes with initial `solutions` are determined readily.\n- **Selective Refinement**: Improvements or variations on any Vibe are made by creating new Vibes with new or refined `solutions` (and potentially refined, more specific `schema` definitions in their `schema` field), allowing changes to be targeted without altering the original. This applies to any Vibe regardless of its class or complexity (for Capability instances, this is how delegation creates more specific capabilities by creating new Capability instances with more specific `schema` definitions).\n- **Distinct Type Mechanisms**: While Vibes share these properties, their class-based patterns (Role, Process, Record, Capability) utilize distinct underlying mechanisms and tool orchestration/evaluation patterns based on their `schema` definitions to determine these Vibes, as detailed in their respective sections.\n\nThis architectural unity ensures consistent handling and compositional flexibility across the system.\n</code></pre>\n<p>As highlighted, while different Vibe Types like Role, Process, Record, and Capability define varied operational patterns for determining <code>solutions</code> or defining authority via their <code>schema</code> definitions, all resulting <strong>Vibes</strong> fundamentally adhere to a common set of architectural principles. Every Vibe shares the {context, <code>schema</code> field, solution} structure (where the <code>schema</code> field contains the <code>schema</code> definition) and is immutable once recorded in the ledger; a specific <code>solution</code> for a given <code>context</code> and <code>schema</code> definition is fixed (for <code>Capability</code> instances, the <code>schema</code> definition itself is fixed upon creation and defines its power). Each Vibe is self-contained, holding all necessary information for its <code>solution</code> to be understood and its conformance to its <code>schema</code> definition verified (for <code>Capability</code> instances, its <code>schema</code> definition is primary for its function). Furthermore, all Vibes (and their <code>solutions</code>/<code>schema</code> definitions) are directly addressable as first-class conversational entities, embodying the system&#39;s content-first approach. Vibes are determined with an initial <code>solution</code> readily (optimistic execution), and support selective refinement: improvements or variations result in new Vibes (for <code>Capability</code> instances, delegation produces a new <code>Capability</code> with a more specific <code>schema</code> definition in its <code>schema</code> field). This universal principle enables iterative development and evolution across all Vibe types, with evolving <code>schema</code> definitions typically becoming more specific.</p>\n<p>This architectural unity ensures consistent handling and compositional flexibility, allowing different Vibe types to be combined seamlessly, their distinctions serving varied computational needs without creating conceptual silos. The Vibe&#39;s Ledger Metadata (UUID, timestamp, author, parent Vibe) is kept separate, ensuring the Vibe&#39;s core content is clean and easily hashable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Alice:</strong> &quot;So the four Vibe Types are really just different ways of categorizing Vibes based on the nature of the <code>schema</code> definition in their <code>schema</code> field, which then dictates how <code>solutions</code> are determined or, in the case of <code>Capability</code> instances, how authority is defined?&quot;\n<strong>Bob:</strong> &quot;Exactly—same fundamental {context, <code>schema</code> field, solution} pattern. The <code>schema</code> field contains the <code>schema</code> definition. The <code>schema</code> definition in the <code>schema</code> field makes the resulting Record <code>solution</code> self-describing and can include or imply built-in tools and trackers.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n","currentChapter":"New Ideas in This Chapter"}}
