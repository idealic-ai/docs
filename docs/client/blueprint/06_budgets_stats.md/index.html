This involves two critical, intertwined concepts: \u003cstrong>segmentation\u003c\\/strong> (how data is grouped) and \u003cstrong>aggregation\u003c\\/strong> (how data is summarized and compressed over time and across segments).

Think of these as the primary keys in the metric records that feed the Budget&#39;s \u003ccode>solution\u003c\\/code>. For a corporate Budget, segments might be \u003ccode>department -&gt; team -&gt; project\u003c\\/code>.

If you initially segment by \u003ccode>team\u003c\\/code> and later want the Budget to analyze by \u003ccode>individual_contributor\u003c\\/code>, backfilling this granularity can be a massive undertaking. It&#39;s often wiser to start with more granular segments than you think the Budget initially needs, as rolling them up is far easier than trying to retroactively subdivide coarser segments.\u003c\\/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Flexibility in Higher-Order Grouping:\u003c\\/strong> While core segments are hard to change, creating higher-order, dynamic groupings from existing segments at query time is straightforward. A Budget can easily be asked to group teams by continent, or analyze performance of &quot;New Initiatives&quot; vs. &quot;Established Products&quot; by dynamically defining these sets based on attributes, without needing &quot;continent&quot; or &quot;product_maturity&quot; as core, physically stored segments.\u003c\\/li>\n\u003c\\/ul>\n\u003ch4>Aggregation &amp; Automated Initial Processing: Feeding the Budget&#39;s Solver\u003c\\/h4>\n\u003cp>Raw data is often too granular for a Budget&#39;s solver to use directly and is costly to store indefinitely.

However, by storing statistical digests, much of the insight into the data&#39;s distribution (like variance or outliers) is preserved even as raw detail is reduced.

This is where the Budget combines, compares, and does more advanced thinkingâ€”like building those composite scores or identifying archetypes. The goal is to turn those clean, aggregated numbers into much deeper insights to drive its decisions.&quot;\u003c\\/p>\n\u003c\\/blockquote>\n\u003ch3>3. Action &amp; Decision Making: Turning Insight into Allocation\u003c\\/h3>\n\u003cp>This is the final and most crucial stage, where the Budget uses the generated insights to make allocation decisions and drive action.\u003c\\/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Set Goals and Manage Performance:\u003c\\/strong> A Budget&#39;s \u003ccode>schema\u003c\\/code> uses metrics as objective benchmarks for establishing realistic goals.

If a \u003ccode>customer_churn_risk_score\u003c\\/code> exceeds a specific threshold, the Budget can automatically allocate resources to a retention workflow, completely bypassing direct LLM intervention.

And if it&#39;s a really complex decision, it packages up all those juicy metrics for the LLM to help it make the best call.

A Budget is the perfect bridge. Instead of raw data, an LLM receives the Budget&#39;s \u003ccode>solution\u003c\\/code>â€”a pre-computed, semantically rich, information-dense payload.\u003c\\/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Reduced Cognitive Load:\u003c\\/strong> All heavy arithmetic is handled by the statistical engine that calculates the Budget&#39;s \u003ccode>solution\u003c\\/code>.

A predicted sales figure can be weighed appropriately against one based on hard historical data. The LLM can understand that a predicted victory is not the same as an actual, observed victory.\u003c\\/li>\n\u003c\\/ul>\n\u003cp>The LLM is used for the &quot;last mile&quot; of fuzzy logic, composing diverse factors from the Budget&#39;s \u003ccode>solution\u003c\\/code> to make a nuanced strategic decision. For everything else, if the metrics and formulas in the \u003ccode>schema\u003c\\/code> can determine the outcome, they do. In these cases, \u003cstrong>the statistics themselves are doing the work; the Budget&#39;s \u003ccode>schema\u003c\\/code> \u003cem>is\u003c\\/em> the work.\u003c\\/strong> This makes the system deterministic, efficient, and reserves LLM capacity for tasks that genuinely require its unique strengths.\u003c\\/p>\n\u003cblockquote>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Alice:\u003c\\/strong> &quot;So, the Budget is like a CFO that prepares a perfect, one-page summary for the CEO, who is the LLM?&quot;\u003c\\/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Bob:\u003c\\/strong> &quot;Exactly! The stats engine and Budget \u003ccode>schema\u003c\\/code> do all the accounting and analysis. The LLM gets the final, concise briefing documentâ€”the \u003ccode>solution\u003c\\/code>â€”and makes the big strategic calls based on that high-quality, pre-digested information.&quot;\u003c\\/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Alice:\u003c\\/strong> &quot;And if the Budget can make a decision with a simple formula, like flagging urgent support tickets based on customer value and issue type, it just does it without bothering the LLM?&quot;\u003c\\/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Bob:\u003c\\/strong> &quot;Precisely. If the metrics and formula can do the job deterministically, let them. That makes the system faster, cheaper, and more predictable for those specific tasks. The LLM is a powerful, sometimes expensive, tool â€“ use it where its unique strengths in handling ambiguity and complex reasoning are truly needed.&quot;\u003c\\/li>\n\u003c\\/ul>\n\u003c\\/blockquote>\n\u003cpre>\u003ccode class=\"language-llm\">Budgets serve as a powerful bridge to LLMs. The budget&#39;s stats engine\nhandles all heavy arithmetic, presenting the LLM with a pre-digested,\ninformation-dense `solution`. This allows the LLM to focus on nuanced,\n&quot;last-mile&quot; strategic decisions using clear semantic signals, rather than\nperforming calculations over raw data, making the entire system more\nefficient and deterministic where possible.\n\u003c\\/code>\u003c\\/pre>\n","currentChapter":"New Ideas in This Chapter"}}</script>
