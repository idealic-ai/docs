This involves two critical, intertwined concepts: \u003cstrong>segmentation\u003c\\/strong> (how data is grouped) and \u003cstrong>aggregation\u003c\\/strong> (how data is summarized and compressed over time and across segments).

Think of these as the primary keys in the metric records that feed the Budget&#39;s \u003ccode>solution\u003c\\/code>. For a corporate Budget, segments might be \u003ccode>department -&gt; team -&gt; project\u003c\\/code>. For a marketing Budget, it could be \u003ccode>campaign -&gt; ad_group -&gt; ad_creative\u003c\\/code>.\u003c\\/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Primacy of Segments:\u003c\\/strong> The core idea is \u003cstrong>segmentation-first\u003c\\/strong>. Raw metrics generated by any activity must inherently carry these segment keys.

If you initially segment by \u003ccode>team\u003c\\/code> and later want the Budget to analyze by \u003ccode>individual_contributor\u003c\\/code>, backfilling this granularity can be a massive undertaking. It&#39;s often wiser to start with more granular segments than you think the Budget initially needs, as rolling them up is far easier than trying to retroactively subdivide coarser segments.\u003c\\/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Flexibility in Higher-Order Grouping:\u003c\\/strong> While core segments are hard to change, creating higher-order, dynamic groupings from existing segments at query time is straightforward. A Budget can easily be asked to group teams by continent, or analyze performance of &quot;New Initiatives&quot; vs. &quot;Established Products&quot; by dynamically defining these sets based on attributes, without needing &quot;continent&quot; or &quot;product_maturity&quot; as core, physically stored segments.\u003c\\/li>\n\u003c\\/ul>\n\u003ch4>Aggregation &amp; Automated Initial Processing: Feeding the Budget&#39;s Solver\u003c\\/h4>\n\u003cp>Raw data is often too granular for a Budget&#39;s solver to use directly and is costly to store indefinitely.

However, by storing statistical digests, much of the insight into the data&#39;s distribution (like variance or outliers) is preserved even as raw detail is reduced. This is crucial for a Budget to have a rich, long-term perspective without being overwhelmed by data.\u003c\\/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Continuous Aggregation Technologies:\u003c\\/strong> The system leverages technologies that automatically and progressively roll up raw data into these pre-aggregated views.

This is where the Budget combines, compares, and does more advanced thinking—like building those composite scores or identifying archetypes. The goal is to turn those clean, aggregated numbers into much deeper insights to drive its decisions.&quot;\u003c\\/p>\n\u003c\\/blockquote>\n\u003ch3>3.

If a \u003ccode>customer_churn_risk_score\u003c\\/code> exceeds a specific threshold, the Budget can automatically allocate resources to a retention workflow, completely bypassing direct LLM intervention.

A Budget is the perfect bridge. Instead of raw data, an LLM receives the Budget&#39;s \u003ccode>solution\u003c\\/code>—a pre-computed, semantically rich, information-dense payload.\u003c\\/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Reduced Cognitive Load:\u003c\\/strong> All heavy arithmetic is handled by the statistical engine that calculates the Budget&#39;s \u003ccode>solution\u003c\\/code>.

A predicted sales figure can be weighed appropriately against one based on hard historical data. The LLM can understand that a predicted victory is not the same as an actual, observed victory.\u003c\\/li>\n\u003c\\/ul>\n\u003cp>The LLM is used for the &quot;last mile&quot; of fuzzy logic, composing diverse factors from the Budget&#39;s \u003ccode>solution\u003c\\/code> to make a nuanced strategic decision. For everything else, if the metrics and formulas in the \u003ccode>schema\u003c\\/code> can determine the outcome, they do. In these cases, \u003cstrong>the statistics themselves are doing the work; the Budget&#39;s \u003ccode>schema\u003c\\/code> \u003cem>is\u003c\\/em> the work.\u003c\\/strong> This makes the system deterministic, efficient, and reserves LLM capacity for tasks that genuinely require its unique strengths.\u003c\\/p>\n\u003cblockquote>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Alice:\u003c\\/strong> &quot;So, the Budget is like a CFO that prepares a perfect, one-page summary for the CEO, who is the LLM?&quot;\u003c\\/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Bob:\u003c\\/strong> &quot;Exactly! The stats engine and Budget \u003ccode>schema\u003c\\/code> do all the accounting and analysis. The LLM gets the final, concise briefing document—the \u003ccode>solution\u003c\\/code>—and makes the big strategic calls based on that high-quality, pre-digested information.&quot;\u003c\\/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Alice:\u003c\\/strong> &quot;And if the Budget can make a decision with a simple formula, like flagging urgent support tickets based on customer value and issue type, it just does it without bothering the LLM?&quot;\u003c\\/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Bob:\u003c\\/strong> &quot;Precisely. If the metrics and formula can do the job deterministically, let them. That makes the system faster, cheaper, and more predictable for those specific tasks. The LLM is a powerful, sometimes expensive, tool – use it where its unique strengths in handling ambiguity and complex reasoning are truly needed.&quot;\u003c\\/li>\n\u003c\\/ul>\n\u003c\\/blockquote>\n\u003cpre>\u003ccode class=\"language-llm\">Budgets serve as a powerful bridge to LLMs. The budget&#39;s stats engine\nhandles all heavy arithmetic, presenting the LLM with a pre-digested,\ninformation-dense `solution`.
