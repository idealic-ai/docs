The purpose here is to clarify the distinct nature and typical content of each Vibe type&#39;s core components.</p>\n<h3>Understanding Schema References (<code>$ref</code>)</h3>\n<p>Vibe schemas often reference other schemas using the <code>$ref</code> keyword. These references follow a URI-like format, typically starting with <code>aug:</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Absolute vs. Local References:</strong><ul>\n<li>An <strong>absolute reference</strong> to a globally shared schema starts with a slash directly after the scheme, e.g., <code>aug:/schemas/SharedSchemaName</code>. These are for common, system-wide definitions.</li>\n<li>A <strong>local reference</strong> (without a leading slash after the scheme, e.g., <code>aug:schemas/UserSpecificSchema</code>) is considered context-dependent (e.g., user-specific, or relative to the current Vibe&#39;s namespace). For the examples in this document, most shared base schemas will use absolute paths.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Evergreen vs. Versioned References:</strong><ul>\n<li>To refer to the latest version of a schema (an <strong>evergreen reference</strong>), omit the version number at the end, e.g., <code>aug:/schemas/BaseVibe</code>. This is typical for extending base templates, ensuring they always use the most up-to-date definition of the base.</li>\n<li>To lock into a specific version of a schema, include the version number, e.g., <code>aug:/schemas/SpecificDefinition:2</code>. This is useful for referencing specific tools or instruction sets where a particular version is critical.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Conceptually similar Vibes (e.g., all &quot;UserProfile&quot; Record Vibes, or all Vibes defining a &quot;StandardProcess&quot;) would typically share identical or very similar <code>schema</code> definitions within their respective <code>schema</code> fields, ensuring structural consistency for Vibes of the same kind.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>1.

The <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> fields are aimed at being clear for both UIs and LLMs.</p>\n<p>The referenced base schemas (<code>aug:/schemas/Vibe</code> and <code>aug:/schemas/RecordVibe</code>) would be defined elsewhere.

This allows the same Role Blueprint to handle various types of requests efficiently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full analysis requests would use all capabilities</li>\n<li>Quick analysis requests (like this example) use only essential capabilities</li>\n<li>Specific tool requests could use just those specific capabilities\nThis pattern ensures efficient processing and clear, focused outputs aligned with user intent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Narrative Blocks Design Pattern:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All narrative blocks</strong> (properties starting with underscore): Provide consistent structural narrative for the vessel, independent of the specific query. They define the vessel&#39;s report framework.<ul>\n<li><code>_IntroductionNarrative</code>: Generic introduction for any investment analysis report</li>\n<li><code>_RecommendationTransition</code>: Fixed transition text (using <code>const</code> in schema)</li>\n<li><code>_ConclusionNarrative</code>: Generic conclusion for any investment analysis report</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Query-specific content</strong> appears only in the capability outputs (MarketAnalysis, InvestmentRecommendation, etc.), not in narrative blocks</li>\n<li>This separation ensures the vessel maintains a consistent structural identity while adapting its analysis content to different queries</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>3.
