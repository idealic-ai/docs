The design separates the concerns of immutable data storage from the management of long-running, stateful processes.</p>\n<h2>Core Components</h2>\n<h3>PostgreSQL for Transactional Integrity</h3>\n<p>The immutable source of truth in the system is the Vibe ledger itself, stored in a PostgreSQL database. All Vibe creation and modification are handled as atomic transactions to ensure data consistency and safety.</p>\n<p>This transactional integrity guarantees that the graph of Vibes and their relationships remains consistent, even in a highly concurrent environment. Key operations, like the <code>refine</code> primitive, are built on this solid foundation. The database provides the durability and queryability needed to manage the Vibe ledger as a permanent, auditable record of all interactions.</p>\n<h3>Temporal for Durable Processes</h3>\n<p>For long-running, stateful operations—specifically, the execution of <code>Process Vibes</code>—Refinery integrates with Temporal. Temporal workflows manage the ephemeral state and complex orchestration logic of a process, ensuring its durability and reliability even in the face of failures.</p>\n<p>When a <code>Process Vibe</code> is executed, a Temporal workflow is initiated to carry out the defined steps. While Temporal handles the durable execution, the final resulting Vibe (the <code>solution</code> of the process) is committed transactionally to the PostgreSQL database via the <code>refine</code> primitive.</p>\n<p>This separation of concerns is critical:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> is the system of record for the &quot;what&quot; – the immutable facts and <code>solutions</code> represented by Vibes.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal</strong> is the system of record for the &quot;how&quot; – the durable, stateful execution of a process over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This dual-system approach allows Refinery to handle complex, long-running tasks without compromising the integrity of the core Vibe ledger, combining the best of transactional data management and durable workflow orchestration.</p>\n","currentChapter":"Core Components"}}
