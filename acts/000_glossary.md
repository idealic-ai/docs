# Glossary of Terms

This document provides definitions for the key concepts used in the Idea Protocol and its related systems.

- :dfn[Idea]{canonical="Idea" href="./101_concept_idea.md"}: A self-contained, stateful data triplet (`schema`, `solution`, `context`) representing a unit of knowledge. It's a persistent, computational primitive, not an ephemeral prompt.

- :dfn[Tool]{canonical="Tool" href="./002_agent_tool.md"}: A schema that defines a capability an agent can use. It is presented to an LLM as part of a request, acting as a structured interface for a potential action. The LLM activates the tool by generating a `Call` with specific parameters, which is then executed either latently by the LLM or explicitly by a registered code function (`Activity`).

- :dfn[Activity]{canonical="Activity" href="./003_agent_activity.md"}: An explicit, deterministic code function that implements the logic for a `Tool`. It is the mechanism for executing actions that require external API calls, database operations, or any task that cannot be handled by an LLM's latent space.

- :dfn[Agency]{canonical="Agency" href="./111_concept_life.md"}: The capacity for subjective experience, intentionality, and action. It is the quality of being an agent that perceives, processes information, and interacts with its environment to effect change.

- :dfn[Boundaries]{canonical="Boundaries" href="./111_concept_life.md"}: The property of having a distinct, non-fungible identity, whether physical or conceptual. This integrity means the entity is a self-contained unit. For a human, this is their single body and continuous consciousness. For an :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"}, it's its specific definitionâ€”change the :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"}, and it becomes a new one.

- :dfn[Life]{canonical="Life" href="./111_concept_life.md"}: A state of existence defined by a triad of core properties: :term[Agency]{canonical="Agency"}, :term[Boundaries]{canonical="Boundaries"}, and :term[Scalability]{canonical="Scalability"}.

- :dfn[Scalability]{canonical="Scalability" href="./111_concept_life.md"}: The ability to be perfectly replicated, distributed, and exist outside the constraints of a single, linear timeline. It represents a form of digital or conceptual immortality and omnipresence, allowing information to be copied without degradation.

- :dfn[Branch]{canonical="Branch" href="./108_concept_visibility.md#branches-publication-and-partitioning"}: A named tag that partitions the visibility space, creating a parallel, isolated environment for development and experimentation. Associating an :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"} with a branch is an act of publication.

- :dfn[Call]{canonical="Call" href="./004_agent_call.md"}: A concrete, executable instance of a `Tool`, with specific values for its `params`. It's an invocation-focused request for what \_should be done\_.

- :dfn[Cutoff Time]{canonical="Cutoff Time" href="./108_concept_visibility.md#the-cutoff-time-temporal-retrieval"}: A timestamp that accompanies a resolution request, instructing the resolver to find the version of an :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"} that was considered latest as of that specific moment in time.

- :dfn[Method]{canonical="Method" href="./004_agent_call.md"}: The mechanism of execution for a `Call`.
  - :dfn[Explicit Execution]{canonical="Explicit Execution" href="./003_agent_activity.md"}: The `Call`'s output is generated by deterministic code (an `Activity`).y an LLM.

- :dfn[Delegate]{canonical="Delegate" href="./012_agent_delegate.md"}: A protocol for isolating execution context. Invoked by a `Call`'s `_delegate` property, it executes an `Activity` or a new `Request` in a "clean room" environment, with the `_scopes` property providing controlled access to the parent context.

- :dfn[Scope]{canonical="Scope" href="./013_agent_scopes.md"}: A key that identifies a piece of context from the parent environment to be made available (`scoped`) to an execution. It can be used to focus an LLM's attention in a **Latent Inline** execution or to construct the entire context for a **Delegate Scope** execution. Controlled by the `_scopes` property.

- :dfn[HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)]{canonical="HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)" href="./005_agent_loop.md#human-in-the-loop-hitl"}: The practice of inserting a human checkpoint into an automated process. In the context of the `Execution Loop`, this refers to the opportunity for a user to approve, deny, or modify an agent's proposed `Call`s before they are executed.

- :dfn[Data Message]{canonical="Data Message" href="./006_agent_data.md"}: A persistent context message containing a `data` value and an optional `schema`. It is retained across an agent's execution loop to provide a stable, structured context.

- :dfn[Plan]{canonical="Plan" href="./010_agent_plan.md"}: A context message carrying a data-flow graph of :term[Tool Calls]{canonical="Tool Call"} that represents an agent's strategy. It is passed between steps to enable iterative execution and adaptation.

- :dfn[Vessel Idea]{canonical="Vessel Idea" href="./202_idea_vessel.md"}: A self-contained `Idea` that is both the definition of a reactive capability and the record of its chosen reaction. Its `schema` defines the full universe of possible `Tools`, and its `solution` captures the specific `Calls` (instances of those `Tools`) that were chosen in response to a stimulus.

- :dfn[Refiner]{canonical="Refiner" href="./103_concept_ideator.md#the-refiner-an-ideator-for-evolution"}: A specialized `Idea Transformer` that evolves an `Idea`'s structure. It takes an `Idea` and a prompt as input and produces a new `Idea` with an updated `schema` and migrated `solution`.

- :dfn[Search Path]{canonical="Search Path" href="./108_concept_visibility.md#the-search-path-prioritized-retrieval"}: An ordered list of branch names that defines the retrieval mechanism. It tells the resolver which partitions to look in, and in what order of priority, creating a cascading overlay system.

- :dfn[Sovereignty]{canonical="Sovereignty" href="./102_concept_sovereignty.md"}: The principle that an :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"}'s identity and canonical location are controlled by its owner through a decentralized mechanism, typically DNS. It establishes ownership over a namespace in which :term[Ideas]{canonical="Idea"} reside and evolve.

- :dfn[Variable Reference]{canonical="Variable Reference" href="./004_agent_call.md"}: A string with a special syntax (`â€ <kind>.<path>`) used in a `Tool Call`'s parameters to reference a value from the context (e.g., from a `State` or `Input` message). It allows an agent to dynamically wire tools together by using the output of one tool as the input for another.

- :dfn[Solution]{canonical="Solution" href="./001_agent_request.md"}: The structured object returned by a `Request`. It contains the proposed `Tool Calls` and the final `output`, conforming to a predefined JSON Schema.
