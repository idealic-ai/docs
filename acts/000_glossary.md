# Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines the key concepts used in the Idea Protocol and its related systems.

- :dfn[Idea]{canonical="Idea" href="./101_concept_idea.md"}: A self-contained, stateful data triplet (`schema`, `solution`, `context`) representing a unit of knowledge. It's a persistent, computational primitive, not an ephemeral prompt.

- :dfn[Ideator]{canonical="Ideator" href="./103_concept_ideator.md"}: An `Idea` that accepts input, signified by a context message of `type: "input"`. It acts as a function, transforming input to output.

- :dfn[Idea Transformer]{canonical="Idea Transformer" href="./103_concept_ideator.md"}: A specialized `Ideator` that takes another `Idea` as its input.

- :dfn[Input Message]{canonical="Input Message" href="./006_agent_input.md"}: A specialized :term[Data Message]{canonical="Data Message"} (with `kind: "input"`) containing a `schema` and `input` data. It defines the expected inputs for a :term[Request]{canonical="Request"}, making it a reusable, function-like component.

- :dfn[Tool]{canonical="Tool" href="./002_agent_tool.md"}: A schema that defines a capability an agent can use. It is presented to an LLM as part of a request, acting as a structured interface for a potential action. The LLM activates the tool by generating a `Call` with specific parameters, which is then executed either latently by the LLM or explicitly by a registered code function (`Activity`).

  >
  > - [002: Agent/Tool](./002_agent_tool.md)

- :dfn[Activity]{canonical="Activity" href="./003_agent_activity.md"}: An explicit, deterministic code function that implements the logic for a `Tool`. It is the mechanism for executing actions that require external API calls, database operations, or any task that cannot be handled by an LLM's latent space.

  > - [003: Agent/Activity](./003_agent_activity.md)

- :dfn[AI-Native]{canonical="AI-Native" href="./105_concept_ai_native.md"}: An architectural paradigm where an AI is the primary engine for a system's entire lifecycle, including its design, execution, evolution, and continuous improvement. It treats AI not as an integrated tool, but as the fundamental medium in which the system operates.

- :dfn[Agency]{canonical="Agency" href="./111_concept_life.md"}: The capacity for subjective experience, intentionality, and action. It is the quality of being an agent that perceives, processes information, and interacts with its environment to effect change.

  > Sidenote:

- :dfn[Boundaries]{canonical="Boundaries" href="./111_concept_life.md"}: The property of having a distinct, non-fungible identity, whether physical or conceptual. This integrity means the entity is a self-contained unit. For a human, this is their single body and continuous consciousness. For an :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"}, it's its specific definitionâ€”change the :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"}, and it becomes a new one.

- :dfn[Life]{canonical="Life" href="./111_concept_life.md"}: A state of existence defined by a triad of core properties: :term[Agency]{canonical="Agency"}, :term[Boundaries]{canonical="Boundaries"}, and :term[Scalability]{canonical="Scalability"}.

- :dfn[Scalability]{canonical="Scalability" href="./111_concept_life.md"}: The ability to be perfectly replicated, distributed, and exist outside the constraints of a single, linear timeline. It represents a form of digital or conceptual immortality and omnipresence, allowing information to be copied without degradation.

- :dfn[Call]{canonical="Call" href="./004_agent_call.md"}: A concrete, executable instance of a `Tool`, with specific values for its `params`. It's an invocation-focused request for what \_should be done\_.

- :dfn[Cutoff Time]{canonical="Cutoff Time" href="./108_concept_visibility.md#the-cutoff-time-temporal-retrieval"}: A timestamp that accompanies a resolution request, instructing the resolver to find the version of an :term[Idea]{canonical="Idea"} that was considered latest as of that specific moment in time.

- :dfn[Delegate]{canonical="Delegate" href="./014_agent_delegate.md"}: A protocol for isolating execution context. Invoked by a `Call`'s `_delegate` property, it executes an `Activity` or a new `Request` in a "clean room" environment, with the `_scopes` property providing controlled access to the parent context.

  > Sidenote:

  > - [014: Agent/Delegate](./014_agent_delegate.md)

- :dfn[Scope]{canonical="Scope" href="./015_agent_scopes.md"}: A key that identifies a piece of context from the parent environment to be made available (`scoped`) to an execution. It can be used to focus an LLM's attention in a **Latent Inline** execution or to construct the entire context for a **Delegate Scope** execution. Controlled by the `_scopes` property.

- :dfn[Loop]{canonical="Loop" href="./010_agent_loop.md"}: An iterative process where an agent makes a sequence of :term[Request]{canonical="Request"}s to achieve a goal. The process continues as long as the LLM determines more information is needed, signified by it returning a list of :term[Call]{canonical="Call"}s instead of a :term[Final Output]{canonical="Final Output"}.
